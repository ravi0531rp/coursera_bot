      "[MUSIC] Hello, I'm Barbara Kahn, and I'm a professor of marketing at the Wharton\n",
      "School. And, I'm here to talk to you about\n",
      "marketing. So this, this segment is Marketing 101,\n",
      "the basics, the principles of marketing. And my focus is going to be on building\n",
      "strong brands because of course the essence of marketing is to have\n",
      "a very strong brand. So, let's start off with the first question, a very basic question but maybe\n",
      "not as obvious as you might think.\n",
      "Which is what is marketing? And I'm going to argue that marketing is\n",
      "the studies of a market. So what's a market? A market is an exchange between two\n",
      "partners, frequently a buyer and a seller, but marketing also, applies to non-profit\n",
      "or things where there isn't necessarily money\n",
      "being transacted. But what you need for marketing to exist\n",
      "or for a market to exist is to have an exchange. And what I'm going to argue is that what\n",
      "marketing means is going to differ as a function of different\n",
      "aspects of those exchange. So let's let's look at the basic exchange. You have one buyer and one seller. And I'm going to give a very simplified\n",
      "view to make a point no markets were ever quite\n",
      "this simple and I'm going to look at the two\n",
      "extremes just to get get a a make my point here. and the real markets are somewhere in the middle. But you'll see when I start defining this,\n",
      "that it's very useful to use this, this kind of\n",
      "simplification. So if we think of an exchange between\n",
      "buyers and sellers. On one extreme we could have what's called\n",
      "a seller's market. And in the seller's market what that means\n",
      "is the seller has a product, and if you want that product, you\n",
      "have to come to the seller. So the seller has all the power. The opposite of that would be a buyer's market where there's lots of\n",
      "competition, a lot of products out there, and the buyer\n",
      "has the power. And what I would argue, and I think would\n",
      "make sense to you too if you think about it, is marketing should not be the\n",
      "same in the seller's market as in the buyer's\n",
      "market. So, in the seller's market, what marketing\n",
      "tends to be is what we call product focus\n",
      "market. You have the product. If the customers want it, they're going to\n",
      "come to you. In that case, you should develop that\n",
      "product to the best of your ability. You should innovate in that product, you\n",
      "should try to reduce cost and you should really focus on\n",
      "the product. Your business objective in a\n",
      "product-focused market is to sell as much as you can, and profitability from a\n",
      "product-focused market is going to come from volume. Selling as much as you can. In the past when we've studied product\n",
      "focus market, we've shown that profitability is tied to\n",
      "market share. So market share becomes your business\n",
      "objective. And why does market share increase\n",
      "profitability? Because the bigger your market share, the\n",
      "more your revenues. And the bigger your market share, and your volume, the lower the product cost and\n",
      "hint profitability. Higher revenues, lower cost, more profit. That's really the goal of a product focused market and when you're product focused, where do you get\n",
      "growth? Will you develop new products based on\n",
      "your product experience or you go to new\n",
      "markets? That's product focused marketing. So what's customer focused marketing?\n",
      "Is it the opposite? And the, and the answer's going to be no,\n",
      "not exactly. In fact, it's quite a different type of\n",
      "marketing. Let's think about it. Customer focused marketing means that I\n",
      "need to focus on the customer to get that customer to buy from me rather than the\n",
      "competition. Well, what's the best way to get the\n",
      "customer to buy from you rather than from the\n",
      "competition? The best way to do it is to look at what\n",
      "that customer wants, and deliver a product that\n",
      "meets the needs of that customer. So where is in product-focused market, I'm\n",
      "the expert, and I create the very best product I can based\n",
      "on my expertise. In a customer-based market, what I'm going\n",
      "to do is look at what the customer wants, and try to create\n",
      "product to meet that customer's need. That's a very different point of view. Some people call it inside-out, this product focus, and outside-in is customer\n",
      "focus. Okay, so now we're going to look at what the customer wants to deliver value to\n",
      "that customer. But, think about it. What does the customer want? Well, the first question is which\n",
      "customer? You can't give every customer what they\n",
      "want, and we know customers are going to want all different\n",
      "things, so the reason why a buyer's market or customer focused\n",
      "marketing is so different than product focus, is that every customer out\n",
      "there, wants something different. If we try to give everybody what they\n",
      "want, we'll go out of business. That's too hard to do. So the intuition of customer focus marketing, is to pick and choose\n",
      "customers. Deliver value to some customers. Say yes to some customers and no to other\n",
      "customers. That's the process of segmentation and\n",
      "they call that, I'm going to talk about that in the next\n",
      "section. But the idea here is that I go after some\n",
      "customers and I say no to other customers. Well, then, how do I become profitable in\n",
      "that? Understand that in a product focused\n",
      "marketing, what we did is sell as much as we can. We sold that product to anybody who wanted\n",
      "that product. In the customer focused market, we're\n",
      "saying no to some customers and yes to others. So, how do we make that profitable? And, the answer is you pick and choose the\n",
      "customers you want to deliver. You deliver value to that customer, give\n",
      "them exactly what they want and that they're willing to\n",
      "pay for, and where the profitability comes from is not from volume, but it's from creating\n",
      "value. How can, how can value-based marketing be\n",
      "profitable? Well, first thing is if I give you exactly\n",
      "what you want, many times, you'd be willing to pay\n",
      "a premium price. Then the profitability comes in not from\n",
      "reduced cost, which we saw in the seller's market side, but from\n",
      "increased price premium. If you give me exactly what I want, I'll\n",
      "be willing to pay a higher price for it. So that's one way. The other way, customer based marketing is\n",
      "profitable is by giving the customer what they want time\n",
      "after time after time. I don't think about just one transaction,\n",
      "I think about building customer loyalty. And, delivering value to that customer\n",
      "over time. That concept is called customer share. Rather than market share, while I try to\n",
      "get a little bit from everybody, the idea of customer\n",
      "share, or share of wallet is that I go after a more narrow\n",
      "market and try to get more from each of that, their,\n",
      "those customer's wallets. And it turns out that loyalty is very,\n",
      "can, if you do it right can be very profitable. And why is loyalty more profitable?\n",
      "Because it's the cost of delivering value to the customer. When I'm doing a customer based marketing\n",
      "it's actually quite expensive to give the customer\n",
      "exactly what they want. Once I figure out what that customer wants\n",
      "and I deliver it to them the first time, it's cheaper to deliver it\n",
      "to them time after time after time. So it's more difficult and more expensive\n",
      "to acquire new customers, but its cheaper to retain those customers over\n",
      "time, and that's where the profitability comes from.\n",
      "It comes from loyalty. The other thing, if you're thinking about\n",
      "building share of wallet in the customer-focused market, is that I not\n",
      "only sell one product to you. I think about other things that you might\n",
      "need and I try to cross sell around it. Let me give you an example of this notion\n",
      "of cross selling. If you've ever gone into a GAP or some\n",
      "jeans store, and, and you go to the cash register and you buy a\n",
      "pair of jeans. The, the cashier or that person behind the counter might say: Oh these are very nice\n",
      "jeans. Do you think you'll need a belt with that? Do you think you'll need socks?\n",
      "That's the notion of cross selling. So I'm selling other things to you besides\n",
      "that one specific product. All of these are the idea of increasing\n",
      "customer share and that's a very important part of\n",
      "customer focused marketing. Give the customer exactly what they want. They'll be willing to pay a premium price\n",
      "for it. Give them what they want, and keep\n",
      "delivering value over time, they will stay loyal to you, and they'll\n",
      "buy over time. And that's more profitability. And if you understand their needs, you can\n",
      "not only deprut, sell them one product, but you can cross-sell other\n",
      "products that may also nee, meet their needs. So in a customer-based market, where\n",
      "profitability come from is premium price, loyalty, and cross\n",
      "selling. Difference between sellers market says you focus on the product, on what the customer\n",
      "does well, and you push that out. And in a customer based market, you focus\n",
      "on the customer, what the customer wants. And you deliver value to the customer\n",
      "better than the competition. So that's the basic difference between product based marketing and customer focus\n",
      "market. Now in today's world the market place has\n",
      "changed even more. What's changed? Well now not only do you have an exchange between buyers and sellers, but because of\n",
      "globalization and because of the Internet and technology and social\n",
      "media and things like that, it's not a one to one\n",
      "conversation anymore. Customers can talk to other customers. That's good and bad. If you're doing a really good job and\n",
      "meeting the, needs of the customers, the fact that they'll buzz to their other\n",
      "customers and tell their, their other friends about what a terrific service your\n",
      "company is doing. Well, that's really good news. On the other hand, if something goes\n",
      "wrong, and they tell their friends something bad, well\n",
      "that's not such good news. And so you have to be really careful, in\n",
      "every transaction with the customer now, that you deliver not only value, but that you deliver a top notch customer\n",
      "experience. Because although what I've been talking about in the\n",
      "seller's market and in a buyer's market has focused on\n",
      "transactions. In the seller's market I've talked about a\n",
      "single transaction. In a buyer's market, I talked about transactions over time or customer\n",
      "loyalty. But in a connected community, if your\n",
      "message is being transmitted by customers to other customers, they talk\n",
      "about the customer experience. What do I mean by customer experience? Lemme give you an example. It starts way before the transaction, and\n",
      "it goes way after the transaction. So for example, if a customer told another customer that their experience at\n",
      "a restaurant. They might say, well I was driving to that\n",
      "restaurant and I hit a lot of traffic, then I got to the parking lot\n",
      "and I couldn't find a parking space, finally when I got into the restaurant, I finally got a table, the\n",
      "meal was really good but then at the end of the\n",
      "meal when I was leaving I tripped and fell. That may be the way they describe the\n",
      "experience at the restaurant. And if that's the way your message about your product is going to be transmitted\n",
      "from customer to customer then you as a\n",
      "marketer need to focus on the entire customer\n",
      "experience. So, one of the things, and we'll talk about this later that's changed in\n",
      "marketing in this world of social media and internet\n",
      "and globalization, is that the marketer has to\n",
      "be completely transparent, has to be\n",
      "authentic, and has to focus on the entire customer\n",
      "experience. One thing else to mention, we're seemingly\n",
      "coming out of a recession now, but there was a global recession, and in the last few years,\n",
      "probably starting about 2008, we had some real strong\n",
      "economic uncertainty. There was a lot of scandals going on.\n",
      "People became skeptical of marketing. Marketing had some bad names, the\n",
      "financial services industry. People lost trust. And so with all those changes in the economic environment, there's been a focus\n",
      "again, in marketing. And marketing now has to focus on\n",
      "authentic, genuine customer value. In order to be profitable, you not only\n",
      "have to deliver customer value over time and in an\n",
      "experiential way, but now because of the tightness of the\n",
      "economy and the uncertainty there, you really have to\n",
      "cut costs and figure out a way to deliver value in a very\n",
      "discipline manner and be very flexible to changes in\n",
      "the market place. So let me just summarize what I've just\n",
      "said. The different types of marketing\n",
      "orientations. There's the product orientation where you\n",
      "focus on the product and you persuade the customer to want what the firm has.\n",
      "There's the marketing orientation. Where you persu, persuade the firm to\n",
      "offer what the customer wants. That's a customer focus approach. The experience orientation says that you\n",
      "not only think about the transaction, and think about the\n",
      "transactions over time. But you try to manage the customer's\n",
      "entire experience with the firm. And when times get tough or customers stop trusting markets, then you\n",
      "need to remember to build that relationship based on\n",
      "authenticity, on trust, and on discipline. And what's the difference in these\n",
      "different types of marks in terms of what you offer? In the production orientation, you're\n",
      "focusing on product innovation, but also reducing\n",
      "costs. So you tend to see generic products and\n",
      "standardization. When you're focusing on customer value,\n",
      "you see differentiated products, and we'll talk about that, when we talk\n",
      "about brands also. How you position your product to meet the\n",
      "needs of the customers better. In an experience orientation you look at\n",
      "experiential value. And when you're going to that tight\n",
      "discipline mindframe or mindset you look at genuine\n",
      "value. And what's the competitive sustainable\n",
      "competitive advantage in each of these markets? In a product orientation the bigger\n",
      "companies win because they tend to have larger market share and lower cost, and\n",
      "lower cost is a big strategic advantage. In a marketing orientation, when you're\n",
      "focusing on the customers, the, the companies that do the best are\n",
      "customers, are companies that really know their\n",
      "customers, that can deliver quality, and that have a lot of customer data and\n",
      "know how to use that data to deliver better\n",
      "value. In an experiential market, you look at\n",
      "transformation. The customer becomes a co-creator of the\n",
      "value, and it's really making the customer and the product one\n",
      "kind of overall experience. And in a trust orientation, the\n",
      "sustainable competitive advantage are the companies\n",
      "that you trust. And that means you've had a long history\n",
      "with them. They're transparent, and you trust them over time. And what are the measurements of\n",
      "profitability? In production orientation as I mentioned,\n",
      "market share is tied to profitability. In marketing orientation, it's share of wallet or customer share, customer\n",
      "loyalty. In experienced market, when you're looking\n",
      "at customers talking to other customers, we start measuring social networks and\n",
      "buzz and word of mouth and referrals. And in a trust orientation, we really\n",
      "focus on reduced costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 002 Building Strong Brands\n",
      "[MUSIC] So, in summary, for just this little section. Let me say that there's three principles\n",
      "of marketing that I've discussed. and this is the essence of what marketing\n",
      "is. The first principle is, if you want to\n",
      "provide something to a customer, to a buyer, and\n",
      "get them to buy from you rather than the\n",
      "competition, you've got to give them real, genuine\n",
      "customer value. That's the principle of customer value. The second principle is the principle of\n",
      "differentiation. You have to provide customer value to that\n",
      "customer, what the customer wants, but you have to do it\n",
      "better than the competition. So you have to differentiate your\n",
      "offering. And the third principle is the principle of segmentation, targeting and positioning\n",
      "says, when you're in a customer focused market, you cannot\n",
      "deliver value to everybody and make money, it's\n",
      "just too difficult to do. So what you do is segment the market into\n",
      "different segments. You target or choose a segment you want to\n",
      "focus on, and you position your brand to meet the needs\n",
      "of that target segment. And what are the tools that you use to\n",
      "deliver these three marketing principles? They're the four P's of marketing. The four P's of marketing are product,\n",
      "place, promotion, and price. Let's go back to that exchange, and that exchange says, you have a buyer and a\n",
      "seller. What the seller puts into the exchange, is\n",
      "the product. What the buyer puts into the exchange is\n",
      "the price. The way the seller communicates the\n",
      "benefits about that product to the buyer is called the\n",
      "promotion. Could be advertising, sales, whatever. And the way the seller delivers the product to the customer, is\n",
      "the place decision. It can be in a physical store. It can be online.\n",
      "It can be through, downloading. Whatever the method of distribution is,\n",
      "that's the place decision. So those are the four P's of marketing,\n",
      "product, place, promotion and price. Typically when you talk about marketing,\n",
      "you talk about the business world. But you can use these principles of\n",
      "marketing in non-profit marketing as well.\n",
      "Think about blood donation. The American Red Cross used marketing principles to get increased in blood\n",
      "donations. Now, let's think about, what is the\n",
      "product for The American Red Cross when they want more\n",
      "blood? It's not blood, is it? Because, that's not what they're putting\n",
      "into the exchange. Blood is actually the price. It's what the customer puts into the\n",
      "exchange. So what is the product? What the American Red Cross did was try to\n",
      "figure out ways to get people to be more willing to\n",
      "donate more blood. So in one way they did, you know, feel good about yourself, you're going to\n",
      "help save lives. That worked for some people. For some people, that wasn't enough. They needed a little sticker that said,\n",
      "yes I s, gave blood today and I saved lives. For other people, the orange juice and the\n",
      "cookies were enough. And it turned out that some of the best blood donation\n",
      "successes they had were in high schools. You can give but, blood donations I think\n",
      "if you're over 16, and it turned out what, one of\n",
      "the products that the American Red Cross could give to\n",
      "high school kids to give blood, was to allow them to\n",
      "miss class. So that was the product there. The promotion again is the way they communicate the benefits of giving blood\n",
      "to the American Red Cross, and the place\n",
      "decision was how they got the product delivered to the, and the exchange made\n",
      "and in this case the American Red Cross had the blood mobile\n",
      "and, and went to the customer. So that was a very innovative,\n",
      "distribution decision. So, you can play around with these four\n",
      "P's in very interesting ways. And, some of the new businesses that we\n",
      "see now are doing some very clever things with\n",
      "these four P's. But, the basic concept should be clear\n",

      "although I've adapted it some. And, the framework or the, well I'm going\n",
      "to think of it as kind of the graph or the strategic tool, is\n",
      "based on a set of principles. These principles have to be true and you\n",
      "have to believe in them in order for this\n",
      "framework to work. And they're very strong principles.\n",
      "They're very strong assumptions. I don't think they're that controversial,\n",
      "but they're not vague, they really are very strong,\n",
      "and in order for this technique to work, you\n",
      "really need to abide by them. And the first one is; that you have to\n",
      "know your markets. Now before I mentioned a lot of, most\n",
      "businesses are now in customer fosed market, customer\n",
      "focused marketing. That is the type of marketing most\n",
      "businesses are doing. because most businesses are very\n",
      "competitive, they're global. There's a lot of competition out there and\n",
      "the only way they're going to win in their market\n",
      "place is to focus on the customer. So, that's a very important principal in\n",
      "this framework, it says, in order to use this framework, we are going to assume\n",
      "that you know what your customers want. And furthermore, you know how your\n",
      "competitors are likely to react. And so what you are trying to do is what I mentioned that principle of\n",
      "differentiation. You're trying to find a way to provide customer value, better than the\n",
      "competition. And the only way you can really deliver this.\n",
      "Is to know your market. So you.\n",
      "And you can't just guess. You have to do market research and you\n",
      "have to really understand what your customers want and\n",
      "how your competition's likely to react. So that's the first principle. The second principle and this is where\n",
      "it's pretty, it's a pretty defined and pretty It's a definite\n",
      "assumption that's being made. And the assumption says and what I've written here is customers have\n",
      "the final say. And what that means is the customers are\n",
      "going to choose what they want. But the assumption is a strong assumption\n",
      "because we assume the customers go through this\n",
      "decision process. They look at all the data and all the\n",
      "values and all the attributes and all the\n",
      "products in the market. And, there's so much information out\n",
      "there. That they can't consider everything. And, so what they do is they kind of chunk a bunch of different things\n",
      "together into kind of three bundles. And the three bundles are. One is all sorts of operations factors. Which includes price and cost. But delivery, service, reliability, those,\n",
      "all of those kinds of things are considered\n",
      "operational things. The other bundle is product features or\n",
      "designs, so product attributes style, innovation, technology and they put that\n",
      "in another bundle. And the third bundle is. Whether or not it meets my needs, so is it\n",
      "customized to meet my needs? And what the customers have the final say\n",
      "says, is that customers look at these three,\n",
      "they kind of classify the products into these three bundles and\n",
      "they kind of give them a score in each one of these three\n",
      "dimensions. And then they decide which one of those dimensions is the most important\n",
      "to them and they pick the product that's the best on one of those dimensions\n",
      "and good enough on the other two. So, it's says, you can't be pretty good in\n",
      "all three of them. Because then the customer won't pick you\n",
      "but the customers going to pick something not that's kind, if they\n",
      "care about price they're not going to pick something that's kind of\n",
      "a good price they going to go for the lowest price or if\n",
      "they care about design it's not going to be something\n",
      "that's kind of good design, they're going to go for the very best design that\n",
      "they like the most. Or if they care about how much it meets their own needs, they're going to go for\n",
      "something that meets their needs the best, as long as the\n",
      "product delivers satisfactorily or good enough on\n",
      "the other two dimensions. So, that's a very strong assumption. But if you think about it, it kind of approximates the way customers\n",
      "make decisions. If you believe that assumption, that the\n",
      "customers have the final say and they choose the product that\n",
      "delivers the best on the bundle of attributes they care the most\n",
      "about, that suggests that if you want to be the first in the markets\n",
      "that you serve. You better be the best at something and\n",
      "good enough at the other two things. And that should be your market strategy\n",
      "and once you decide on which type of thing you going to be the best at,\n",
      "the market leader at, then that have indications for the way\n",
      "you structure your business, the way you prioritize resources, the way you allocate\n",
      "resources, the type of people you hire into your company. It has all sorts of implications for your\n",
      "business organization so that you can deliver total value and total quality and guarantee the customer satisfaction on\n",
      "this dimension. So, those are the assumptions. Now, before I show you the framework I\n",
      "have to introduce one other concept and this concept is what\n",
      "I'm going to call, fair value. And what I have on the screen here is a\n",
      "value map. And you have on the vertical axis,\n",
      "relative costs to the customer. And on the horizontal axis, relative\n",
      "benefits. And what the map says is that if you offer more benefits, customers are willing to\n",
      "pay a higher price. If you charge a lower price, customers will expect fewer benefits, as\n",
      "long as what you offer appears to be fair. If you offer something inferior and it's not fair value, then customers won't buy\n",
      "that. So it, you won't make it in the market. You'll be, it'll be cancelled out of the market because you're not offering a fair\n",
      "value. And what the framework says is that you\n",
      "need to offer fair value on two of those bundles, but offer\n",
      "something better than fair value on one of the bundles, on the bundle you are\n",
      "going to be the leader on. So if you can imagine a marketplace where\n",
      "everybody is trying to deliver fair value and somebody is\n",
      "delivering something of superior value. Think about what's going to happen in that\n",
      "marketplace, in a very competitive market. Somebody comes out, let's say Apple comes\n",
      "out with a better design and so the iPad comes out and it's a much better design. It, it fair price on these other axis, but there are, their tablet is better than\n",
      "everything else. What happens in the marketplace? And what happens is everybody tries to\n",
      "copy and mitigate the advantage. And so what happens is what's perceived to\n",
      "be fair value, that fair value line is not a\n",
      "static line. It's constantly moving up, moving to the\n",
      "lower right as the market gets more and more\n",
      "competitive. So what's fair value is constantly\n",
      "changing over time. So although I say what you need to do in this framework is to deliver the best\n",
      "of something and state fair value on the other two\n",
      "bundles, the problem is fair value's not a static\n",
      "constant concept. It's constantly changing as a function of\n",
      "competitive reaction. So, with that said as background, here's\n",
      "the framework. And here are the three bundles; one of\n",
      "them is operational excellence, the other's performance superiority, that's\n",
      "the bundle that delivers on product design and style. And the third is customer intimacy, which\n",
      "says give the customers what they want. And, you're intimate with customer needs\n",
      "and you try to deliver something that's responsive\n",
      "to their needs. And so the three crosshatches here are fair value lines. Now I had them drawn symmetrically on this\n",
      "axis, but it doesn't have to be symmetric. What you need to do is, if you want to use\n",
      "this framework. Is in your marketplace, figure out, what\n",
      "are the product attributes that relate to\n",
      "operational excellence in your market. And define that dimension. So that you understand what operational\n",
      "excellence is in your market. You have to do the same thing, or what are the product attributes that\n",
      "matter to the customer? Are they design, technology, whatever it\n",
      "is, what are those attributes and define that\n",
      "dimension. And then you have to figure out how much customization is there in your market and\n",
      "define that dimension. That's the first thing you do. The second thing you do with this framework, is anticipate where fair value\n",
      "is. This is the trickiest part of this\n",
      "framework. What are customers expectations on each.\n",
      "Think of these as axis.\n",
      "Like an x, y, and z axis. And where is the reference point or the fair value line on each of these axis\n",
      "points. Sometimes people think about fair values,\n",
      "the average of what everybody offers. Sometimes fair value, nobody offers. Like for example, I would say in the\n",
      "airline business, people expect an operational\n",
      "excellence, constant on time arrival. And we know very few airlines deliver to that fair value.\n",
      "But that is. What I think people expect and I would\n",
      "say, most of the competitors in the market are below\n",
      "fair value. Sometimes, everybody's above fair value. In some mature markets, people don't care\n",
      "about some of the bells and whistles that come\n",
      "out. And everybody's delivering at least what\n",
      "they need. And some people more. But people didn't even care about that. So figuring out exactly where fair value\n",
      "is and each of these axis is a very tricky thing and you need market\n",
      "research to do that. Once you figure out where your value is,\n",
      "on these, the next part is to plot, where your company is delivering, on each of\n",
      "these axes relative to fair value. Are you above fair value in operations? Are you meeting fair value or below fair\n",
      "value on each one of these axes? Then you figure out where you competition\n",
      "is on each one of these axes and then you start playing the market strategy\n",
      "game. You think about a short-term strategy, a\n",
      "long-term strategy and you figure out What should you be doing right now in\n",
      "order to beat the competition? And what you're ultimately looking for in\n",
      "a long term strategy is to be the best at one dimension and good\n",
      "enough on the other two. That's the long term strategy.\n",
      "In the short term it might be that let's say your long term strategy is to be customer intimate, but you're not at fair\n",
      "value in operations. So in the short term you might be looking\n",
      "to hit fair value in operations, but in the long term you're looking to be the leader in customer\n",
      "intimacy. And once you decide what your leadership\n",
      "strategy is then that has implications for everything you\n",
      "do in your firm. So for example if you are an operational\n",
      "company and that's what you want to be your leadership\n",
      "strategy, that tends to be a very hierarchical strategy that, with\n",
      "allocation of resources prioritized to information\n",
      "technology et cetera. If you are a performance superiority\n",
      "company, that tends to be more of an R and D company. You tend to hire kinds of people that are. Very innovative, they don't like\n",
      "structure, they don't like top-down organization, you really\n",
      "need to give them a lot of free reign.\n",
      "And in a customer intimacy, you really have to focus on prioritizing\n",
      "market research, customer knowledge and you kind of have a\n",
      "consulting, a yes culture. You have to let the customer come first.\n",
      "So each, once you decide on your leadership strategy has a lot of\n",
      "implications for the rest of the firm. [MUSIC].\n",

      "## 004 Segmentation And Targeting\n",
      "[MUSIC] So, in this section, what we'd like to talk about is that concept I mentioned\n",
      "earlier, segmentation. Segmentation and targeting. And this is a critical idea for marketing\n",
      "and very important for where we're going,\n",
      "which is brand positioning. It's called the STP framework:\n",
      "segmentation, targeting and positioning. And when we get to positioning, that's when we first start getting to branding\n",
      "which is where we're headed. So, the positioning process says, yous\n",
      "tart with segmentation, with S of STP. And segmentation says that you identify\n",
      "variables that allows one to segment the market. Okay. So I, we're going to figure out different\n",
      "schemes for how to break up the market into different\n",
      "market segments. The second part, the T is targeting. You would evaluate the attractiveness of\n",
      "each of the segments and you choose a segment to\n",
      "target. And the third piece is positioning. Once you get your targets segment, you\n",
      "position your brand and your product to meet the needs of that\n",
      "target segment. STP, segmentation targeting and\n",
      "positioning. So let me just give you the idea of why\n",
      "this is so important to have segmentation targeting and positioning. And what I'm putting up on the background\n",
      "now, is a slide that shows you the importance values two\n",
      "different segments have for roof tiles. So in this graphic, you can see the yellow segment, doesn't think price is\n",
      "that important. They don't care about whether or not it's\n",
      "a low price. But they do care about how attractive the\n",
      "tiles look. And they really care about how durable the\n",
      "pu, tiles are. On the other hand, the blue segment, they\n",
      "care a lot about the price. They want a low price. They don't really care that much about how\n",
      "it looks, and they don't care that much about how long\n",
      "the tiles last. If you did not segment this market, the\n",
      "optimal thing to do would be to give average value to\n",
      "everything. And, what you would do, therefore, is not\n",
      "please anybody. The average value here would not be not a\n",
      "low enough price for the people who care about\n",
      "low price. And not enough durability for the people\n",
      "who care about durability. In some sense I think that is the lukewarm\n",
      "tea. You can have hot tea, an ice tea and if you give average it's lukewarm tea and\n",
      "nobody is happy. So one of the reasons to segment the\n",
      "market is if you don't, you tend to try to reduce cost and go to the average value and you are not meeting\n",
      "anybody's needs. Going back to that concept of customer\n",
      "focus marketing, if I want to give you exactly what you want, I need to\n",
      "segment the market. And what you'll see is there's a heterogeneity or differences in\n",
      "preferences. And then I need to choose or target; which\n",
      "one of these segments I want to deliver to, and\n",
      "deliver value to that segment. And for example, in this case if I delivered, durable tiles, to the seg-, the\n",
      "yellow segment. They would be willing to pay a higher\n",
      "price for that, and I could be very profitable, but if I went to a lukewarm thing, I, might not sell to\n",
      "anyone. So segmentation means I divide the market\n",
      "up into market segments. in fact, let me just define it formally\n",
      "here. Market segmentation is the process of\n",
      "dividing up the market into distinct subsets, where any\n",
      "subset could conceivably be selected and then you pick one of those\n",
      "market seqments to be your target. And you reach or you deliver to that\n",
      "customer segment, that market segment, with a\n",
      "distinct marketing mix. Remember what the marketing mix is, the four p's, product, place, promotion and\n",
      "price. And what that says, when I'm looking at these different segments, they may want\n",
      "different products. It may make sense to advertise to them differently.\n",
      "It may make sense to price differently. It may make sense to deliver at a place decision, or distribute to them\n",
      "differently. and so that's the definition of market\n",
      "segment, a very, very critical idea in, in\n",
      "marketing. So the question is how can I divide up the\n",
      "market? And you might understand the idea that I'm\n",
      "going to go after market segments and I'm going to\n",
      "choose one of them. And then I'll give a unique product package, or marketing\n",
      "mix, to one of those segments. Maybe you understand that concept. But then the question is well, what are\n",
      "the different ways to segment the market? And there are actually lots of different\n",
      "ways. The most common way that people most, that\n",
      "usually think about is to divide up the market on\n",
      "characteristics of the customer. So intuitively, you might think about\n",
      "demographics. Well, men and women like different things,\n",
      "so let's make a female product and a male\n",
      "product. Or, old people like things that are\n",
      "different than young people, or rich people have different\n",
      "needs than poor people. So one of the segmentation schemes people frequently think about are characteristics\n",
      "of the customer. Another one though, which doesn't really\n",
      "focus on characteristics of the customer says, well people like\n",
      "different things in products. They focus on different benefits so, in\n",
      "running shoes, some people care about comfort, some\n",
      "people care about asthetics. Some people care about technology, and so it might\n",
      "make sense to divide up the market or segment the market on\n",
      "benefits that people seek. A third way to think of it is how do\n",
      "people purchase? Maybe they purchase online. Some people purchase online, some people\n",
      "like to go to physical stores, some people like to use their phones or\n",
      "some people purchase very frequently. Some people only purchase once a year. Some people like to switch around, other people like to be loyal. All of these are different characteristics\n",
      "that you can use to segment the market. Let me just give you a few examples of\n",
      "some of the interesting ways that people have segmented the\n",
      "market, just to give you some ideas. One of the ones, people talk about\n",
      "demographics so they talk about old versus young, male\n",
      "versus females. City dwellers versus country dwellers. Another thing that and I'm sure you've\n",
      "heard of this. You may not know it by this term. Another way to think about it is cohort\n",
      "analysis. And what cohort analysis says, it's not\n",
      "really whether you're young or old, it's the life experiences that\n",
      "you've experience as a cohort. And in particular it's very important what\n",
      "happens when you're coming of age, you know, right around 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,\n",
      "that, those kind of. Those things that hit you at that time of\n",
      "your life are critical, and they frame you as a\n",
      "generation. And so this is the idea, you've heard\n",
      "probably of baby boomers. That's a cohort. Baby boomers were born, there's two\n",
      "cohorts of baby boomers. There's one that are born about 1950 and\n",
      "then the ones that are born you know about\n",
      "1960s. and those that cohort of baby boomers. All come of age at a certain time, certain\n",
      "things happen when they come of age, and they react as a generation. Generation X is another cohort and what\n",
      "you're hearing about nowadays is really is\n",
      "Generation Y. people who are coming of age now, these\n",
      "are the kids who are in college. they think of Generation Y, Millennials. and why do we really focus on the current\n",
      "generation? Who's in college now, what's that current\n",
      "generation? Marketers are very interested in the\n",
      "generation as they come of age, when they are in college or when\n",
      "they're this age. Because many times, you make purchases at\n",
      "this age and then you're loyal to those brands over\n",
      "time. So it's, marketers feel it's very, very\n",
      "important to get in those people's consideration sets,\n",
      "right, at this time. So they spend a lot time studying, the\n",
      "cohort of today and today's cohort is Generation Y. Generation Y is very different from all\n",
      "the other generations. First of all, it's a generation that was\n",
      "completely brought up on the computer. they think about free content. they think about the social environment, they're totally comfortable social\n",
      "network, everything's wireless. They think about things being designed\n",
      "exactly for them. They're totally used to customization. This is a generation, electronic\n",
      "generation that's quite different from their parents and from generations\n",
      "beforehand. And you really need to understand\n",
      "Generation Why or the Millennials in order to market to\n",
      "them. What they don't like is mass marketing. They don't like any kind of restricted\n",
      "access. They don't like thing that are going down\n",
      "the beaten path. They like new, they like different, they\n",
      "like customized. Millenials are big shoppers, but many\n",
      "times the co-purchase with their parents, some of the millenials still live with,\n",
      "and are supported by their parents. They think about information\n",
      "electronically. They are not readers of paper newspapers,\n",
      "they don't care about print anymore. They're very, very comfortable comfortable multi-tasking and co-creating with the\n",
      "product. They're very connected, and the millenials\n",
      "tend to be socially responsible. So if you're segmenting the market by\n",
      "cohorts and you decide to target the millenials, you would have\n",
      "to design a targeted product or position your brand in a\n",
      "specific way to meet the needs of the millenials. Another way that markets tend to be\n",
      "segmented are by geography. It turns out that people who are similar tend to live together in the same\n",
      "neighborhoods. And there are different ways to segment,\n",
      "there's segmentation scheme called prism. That actually defines the entire country\n",
      "based on these geographic clusters. And they're not, eh, they're not defined\n",
      "necessarily about where they are. So you could have a geographic cluster with some characteristic sets in\n",
      "California. And people who live in New York may be in\n",
      "that same, same cluster. So people who live in say Beverly Hills\n",
      "California, may be similar to people who live in Scotia,\n",
      "Scotia New York. And those two may be in the same cluster, even though they're separated by\n",
      "3000 miles. So the PRIZM clustering, or zip clustering\n",
      "says, if you tell me your zip code, and I'm giving you a\n",
      "United States example. But this kind of notion of geographic\n",
      "segmentation is true around the world. People who are similar tend to live in\n",
      "neighborhoods that are similar. And so you tell me where you live, I have\n",
      "some ideas of the kinds of things you might\n",
      "like, the products you might like, the clothes you might\n",
      "wear. The media you may attend to ecetera. And what we find out and we'll talk about\n",
      "later on in, in one of the other parts of this program when\n",
      "David Bell comes and talks to you. That it turns out that where you live physically also affects your online\n",
      "behavior. So location is a very very important\n",
      "variable when thinking about segmentation. And there are lots of maps that can divide up say\n",
      "the New York City for example. Into a block by block, by block\n",
      "segmentation scheme. And show different consumer behavior by\n",
      "blocks in New York City. That's how tight the segmentation\n",
      "geographic segmentation can be. Once you define your segmentation\n",
      "variables, then you need to select a target segment. and so what makes a segment attractive you\n",
      "need to balance the attractiveness of the segment\n",

      "## 005 Brand Positioning\n",
      "[MUSIC]. So in this section I want to finish with\n",
      "the, where we talked about STP, we talked about segmentation, we talked about targeting\n",
      "and now I want to talk about about positioning\n",
      "that's the key, but in thinking about positioning I really want you to\n",
      "think about what is a brand? Because one of the most important aspects\n",
      "of a brand, is brand positioning. It's also the positioning in the STP\n",
      "framework, but it's really the essence of the brand, the\n",
      "brand positioning. So, let's start with what is a brand, and then we'll get into this notion of\n",
      "positioning. But, just to anticipate where I'm going,\n",
      "positioning is positioning your product to meet the needs of the\n",
      "target segment. That's the basic definition. But, one of the ways I'm, I'm going to\n",
      "focus on is a way to do that is to brand that\n",
      "positioning. And so I really want to get to this notion\n",
      "of what is a brand. Formally a brand is just a trademark. If you have a brand you want to legally protect your brand and trademark\n",
      "it. and that's if you talk to lawyers about a brand they'll talk about it as a\n",
      "trademark. But we as marketers know that a brand is\n",
      "way more than just a tren, trademark. People have in the past talked about\n",
      "brands as a relationship or a contract. A promise of the company of certain\n",
      "specific benefits to the customer. So some kind of brand relationship, or\n",
      "branded relationship. and so it's much more than just a\n",
      "trademark, it's a promise, it's consistency, it's benefits, it's, it's\n",
      "what you come to expect from a brand. and that's been the traditional definition\n",
      "of what a brand is. In today's world, a brand is a little bit\n",
      "bigger than that. Because, we mentioned before, this is a\n",
      "connected community, and customers are talking to\n",
      "other customers. Really, what a brand is, and the real definition of a brand.\n",
      "Is whatever the customer thinks it is. That's what the brand is. What sits in your customer's heads,\n",
      "regardless of what you try to put there, is what your brand\n",
      "actually is. So if, if you have a very strong branded\n",
      "message and it's something like Disney which is a very strong brand\n",
      "name and a very clear positioning. Then hopefully what Disney thinks their brand is, is what the customers think it\n",
      "is. But if your message is not so clear and\n",
      "you want your brand to mean something, but what the\n",
      "customers think is something different. Guess who wins.\n",
      "It's the customers. That's what your brand is, what sits in\n",
      "the customers head. And so a lot of what marketing is and\n",
      "understanding about brands is to do market research to understand how\n",
      "customers do think about your brand. Now when we're talking about the notion of\n",
      "positioning. And so a positioning statement is a definition or positioning statement for a\n",
      "particular brand. I have here two examples of positioning\n",
      "statements. For two brands of personal computers. These are a little bit old, it's when Apple and IBM were really focusing on\n",
      "personal computers. But I want to use these examples because they're very clear, crisp positioning\n",
      "statements, and I think we can learn a lot by understanding these positioning\n",
      "statements. So let's look first at Apple computer's\n",
      "positioning statement. And if we read that, it says Apple Computer offers the best personal\n",
      "computing experience to students, educators, creative\n",
      "professionals and consumers around the world through its innovative hardware,\n",
      "software and internet offerings. That's one positioning statement.\n",
      "Compare that to IBM, which was very, very different at\n",
      "the time. IBM is for businesses who need computers. IBM is the company you can trust for all\n",
      "of your needs. Very, very different positioning. That is a really good positioning\n",
      "statement when one company can be so differentiated from the other company, they're going after different target\n",
      "segments. and it should be quite clear by the\n",
      "positioning statement. Let's break that positioning statement into its parts,\n",
      "so that we can understand what a good positioning\n",
      "statement has. And let's focus here on the Apple\n",
      "Computer. There's three pieces to the positioning\n",
      "statement. There's who is the target segment, what is\n",
      "the point of difference that they're offering to that target segment and then\n",
      "there's what is the frame of reference? In the frame of references, who are the\n",
      "other competitors that they are comparing themselves to? The target segment here, and it you think\n",
      "about Apple, the target segment is students,\n",
      "educators, creative professionals. A brand should have a crisp target\n",
      "segment. Even if that's not the only people who use\n",
      "the product. So nowadays, Apple's so popular that you\n",
      "know, everybody has an Apple. Your grandmother has an apple. You know, somebody who's not a student has\n",
      "an Apple. not just creative people anymore. Yet, even though Apples are ubiquitous and\n",
      "lots and lots of people have Apple, Apple\n",
      "products. Still it's positioned to creative people. It's a very designy brand. So, it still has a very clear target\n",
      "segment, even if that doesn't limit who might use\n",
      "the product. It has a point of difference.\n",
      "What's a point of difference for Apple? It's innovative.\n",
      "Apple offers state of the art products. We look for design innovation from Apple,\n",
      "so that's its point of view. And in this case what's the frame of\n",
      "reference? In this particular positioning statement\n",
      "it's other personal computers. Personal computing experience. So you have these three pieces to a strong positioning statement, the target segment,\n",
      "the point of difference. And the frame of reference.\n",
      "And positioning is defining the value proposition in these three\n",
      "terms, the target market, the point of difference, and the\n",
      "point of parity. Now you can play around with this and if you think about this and get into it a\n",
      "little bit you may realize that your point of\n",
      "difference is going to be relative to the frame of\n",
      "reference. So for example let me give you an example\n",
      "of Crest, this product isn't on the market anymore\n",
      "but it's Crest made this chewing gum.\n",
      "If the Crest chewing gum was referred to, the frame of reference was\n",
      "other toothpaste products, then Creth, Crest chewing gum's point of difference is\n",
      "it's a toothpaste product. That's in gum four, okay? On the other hand, if you take Crest\n",
      "chewing gum and compare it as a frame of reference to other\n",
      "chewing gums, the point of difference is, this is a chewing gum\n",
      "that has toothpaste in it. So, these two things go together and part\n",
      "of the art of coming up with a good positioning, is figuring out\n",
      "who's the right target market to go after. And also, what's the frame of reference, and what's going to be your point of\n",
      "difference, and playing around with those two pieces\n",
      "is a lot of the art of positioning. Very important concept, but you really\n",
      "need to understand these three ideas, target marketing, point of difference and\n",
      "frame of reference or point of parity. And what you're going to do is, because\n",
      "once you decide on your positioning statement, you use all\n",
      "of the elements of the marketing mix that we've already talked about, product, price, promotion and\n",
      "place, to position your product to meet the needs\n",
      "of the target segment. And positioning should be clear and simple\n",
      "and focus on a few key benefits. sometimes people talk about this as a\n",
      "unique selling proposition. the position must be defensible, so you\n",
      "want to take a positioning that you own and that other\n",
      "people can't copy very easily. And the really important thing is you\n",
      "cannot be everything to everyone. If you do that you have no position. You must make choices.\n",
      "You must focus. You must choose a target segment.\n",
      "You must choose a point of difference. You must choose a frame of reference to\n",
      "have a clear positioning. Because if you try to be everything,\n",
      "you're going to end up being lukewarm tea, and that is not a good\n",
      "brand position. Positioning, once you have the good brand\n",
      "positioning, that should determine what products you\n",
      "develop, and positioning is a strategic idea, so you really want to\n",
      "think about this in terms of what are, what's your\n",
      "target segment, what do customers want, what's\n",
      "your competition, what is your position relative to the\n",
      "competition? All of that is a big picture strategic\n",
      "vision. That is distinct from messaging. Messaging is tactical. Once you have your brand positioning, you\n",
      "can decide things like, what color should the brand be or what\n",
      "should the symbol be or what should the logo be, and we're\n",
      "going to talk about those in the third, in the third\n",
      "section of my. At my part here but that's very much\n",
      "tactical and messaging. Positioning at the level I'm talking about\n",
      "it right here, this is very much a strategic\n",
      "idea. And a very important piece of this is this\n",
      "point of parity or frame of reference. These are, so I want to spend a little bit more time thinking about this just so that\n",
      "you understand. It's a part of the positioning statement,\n",
      "but it's associations that are not unique to the brand. They are these frame of reference, they're associations that are shared with other\n",
      "brands. And you want to think about these point of parity as things that are necessary for\n",
      "the category. So something a brand must have to be\n",
      "considered in this frame of reference. So for example, if your frame of reference\n",
      "is a grocery store, then people think, in order to be a\n",
      "grocery store it has to have produce or it has to have fresh\n",
      "product, that's what a grocery store is. And if it doesn't have that it's not a\n",
      "grocery store. So, one of the things you think about in\n",
      "terms of these points of parity. Are what are the conditions that your\n",
      "brand must have, that they share with the competition to be part\n",
      "of that set? And then you want to think about points of\n",
      "parity sometimes is ways to negate, a, a, a\n",
      "competitor's point of difference. So, for example, in toothpaste, when one\n",
      "of the brands, and I can't remember which one, first came out with\n",
      "fluoride and as a cav, cavity preventer. And that was a differentiator. All of the other brands copied and put\n",
      "fluoride in their toothpaste. Suddenly it's a frame of reference, it's a\n",
      "point of parity. All toothpaste now has fluoride. So what I've done is negated the point of\n",
      "difference of the first innovator, who came out with\n",
      "fluoride toothpaste. I have this slide up here. On January 9th, 2007, a few years ago when\n",

      "and probably you, many of you probably don't\n",
      "remember it used to be Apple Computer, but what I, the\n",
      "point I'm making here is, when he changed the\n",
      "name of the company, think about just for a\n",
      "second and see if you can get this idea, which one of the three aspects of the brand positioning\n",
      "did he change? Did he change the target segment? Did he change his point of difference? Or did he change his frame of reference? It should be clear he changed his frame of\n",
      "reference. Target segment, still creative young\n",
      "people. Point of difference, still innovation. But now the frame of reference is not\n",
      "computers but it's consumer electronics, and I believe when\n",
      "he made this change was the same time he introduced the iPhone or,\n",
      "and he really was in consumer electronics, and it was no\n",
      "longer the frame of reference comparing to other personal\n",
      "computers. The point of difference, I think is more\n",
      "clear to people what that is. It's strong, favorable, unique brand\n",
      "associations. Some people talk about this as a unique\n",
      "selling proposition. It's a similar concept. And what you want it to do is to have it\n",
      "be sustainable. You want a competitive advantage, a point\n",
      "of difference that you can hold, and that it's difficult for\n",
      "competition to copy. and it can, it can be a lot of different\n",
      "things; it can be product attributes, performance\n",
      "attributes, it can be imagery, it can be benefits, it can be design, it\n",
      "can be anything that you can own and that really\n",
      "differentiates your brand. When you're choosing a point of\n",
      "difference, you want to make sure that it's desirable to\n",
      "the customer. Is it relevant, is it distinctive? You also want to make sure that you can\n",

      "out again, what's the essence of the brand, what's the brand mantra, is\n",
      "to develop what's called a mental map. And what a mental map is a kind of a\n",

      "benefits are. And, and in what way the brand delivers on\n",
      "them. Now it's probably easiest to give you some\n",
      "examples. Before I do that though, let me just say\n",
      "again, what the brand mantra is used for. It's used internally to guide decisions.\n",
      "I think I already mentioned this. It's what the brand should and shouldn't\n",
      "be. By the way, that's a very important idea. A brand mantra, not only, says what a\n",
      "brand is. But as importantly it says what a brand is\n",
      "not. and you really want to have, almost black and white, that idea.\n",
      "This is a Nike. This is not a Nike. That kind of idea. And it communicates the baoundries of the\n",
      "brand. It, it, it has to be short, simple and it\n",
      "should be inspirational. So now we have the examples. these are very famous ones. Nike, they're global brands, Nike, Disney,\n",
      "McDonald's. so Nike is authentic, athletic, performance. The all, just do it, be real, you know,\n",
      "the, that's authentic. It, it's very much an athletic brand.\n",
      "It's not just shoes, it's clothing. But when you think of Nike, you think\n",
      "about athletic, and it's about performance and the, the technique, or the\n",
      "ability to, that can, just do it. That kind of notion. Disney and McDonald's are kind of\n",
      "interesting, because they both are about family fun,\n",
      "and, and they actually both have a lot of\n",
      "things in common. But the brand mantra is different. Disney is about entertainment. Now that is not to say that Disney doesn't\n",
      "have food. Disney sells quite a bit of food at their parks and in different places that\n",
      "they have. But when you think Di-, Disney, you think\n",
      "fun family entertainment. And even the food comes within that brand\n",
      "mantra of, of Disney, of entertainment. McDonald's, on the other hand, is fun and family. But its food, and even if you have a\n",
      "McDonalds playground or something like that, you still think of it\n",
      "as the food first. And so, although these are similar and you\n",
      "know, what. In some sense, you can see they're\n",
      "actually also quite, quite different and I don't think you'd ever get\n",

      "[MUSIC] So in this last segment, we're really\n",
      "defining what a brand is. we, we've talked about what marketing is,\n",
      "we've talked about marketing strategies,\n",
      "competitive analysis, customers values. We talked about the idea of Segmentation\n",
      "targeting and positioning, and the core, core concept of a good strong brand,\n",
      "which is brand positioning. And brand positioning that's so sharp that\n",
      "you can define it in just three words, in 30 seconds as a brand mantra.\n",
      "That's kind of where we've gone. Right down to a sliver of a sharp\n",
      "definition of what a brand is. And in this last piece of this, I want to talk about the notion of\n",
      "experiential brand. When we talked about what is marketing. And we talked about things changing from\n",
      "the sellers market to a buyers market to the connected\n",
      "community. In the connected community, that's when this notion of customer experience comes\n",
      "in. And brands like. just general markets and customers experiences also have become very\n",
      "experiential. So its not enough to just define a brand\n",
      "in terms of a crisp, clear brand mantra and a crisp, clear\n",
      "brand positioning, but you also have to define all of the experience that\n",
      "exists around the brand. What's the smell of the brand? What's the feel of the brand?\n",
      "All sorts of other things now become part of what the brand is in this\n",
      "new experiential world that we live in. So, what's an experience? an experience is a process that occurs as\n",
      "a result of living through a situation. Undergoing that situation. So it's not just a moment in time, it's a dynamic notion where you sense or feel\n",
      "this experience. as I'm going to define it later, you'll see that\n",
      "it involves all the senses, it's social, it's behavioral,\n",
      "it's cognitive, it's emotional. It's stimulations that are triggered to\n",
      "the sense that you think about, that you feel. they connect the company and the brand to\n",
      "the customer, and they place the the customer action and the, the\n",
      "individual's actions and purchase occasions in a broader social context. So the experience includes all of these\n",
      "kinds of things. It's What I've been talking about, up to this point really, is pretty cognitive,\n",
      "pretty rational. And here's where we bring in the emotions\n",
      "and all these other things, and I know those\n",
      "of you who know and love brands really understand\n",
      "that brands are emotional, they're experiential, they're\n",
      "not just this hard and fast cognitive point of view.\n",
      "And so that's what I, I'm emphasizing here on the point I want to end with in this\n",
      "section, that a brand is an experience. And so, the things on the left are\n",
      "important. I'm going to talk about those but they all have to be augmented to be bigger than\n",
      "that. And to embody this experience or emotional\n",
      "piece. So we talked about differentiation. That's a principle of marketing, to be\n",
      "differentiated, the point of difference. But now, and today's brand, these rich brands, are not just differentiated,\n",
      "they're experientially differentiated. So the different, the differentiation is\n",
      "also in the brand experience. It's not just a single promise. It's a relationship. You, you feel towards your brand, the\n",
      "brands that you just love. If you're an Apple lover, or you're an\n",
      "Abercrombie lover, or something, you have a relationship with that brand;\n",
      "it's over time, and it defines you. It's not just brand attributes, these\n",
      "cognitive at-, or these performance attributes, or these\n",
      "product attributes. It's a personality, you think the brand\n",
      "almost as a friend. It's not static, it's dynamic. It's not a mass brand, because you're\n",
      "co-creating with the brand. The brand becomes very individualized. Becomes, very relevant to you. You're not just aware of this brand,\n",
      "you're aware of how this brand fits into your\n",
      "life. So you can see by the types of words I'm\n",
      "saying that Really, really strong brands embody\n",
      "all of this emotional experience. and so when you define these terms, these\n",
      "things that I've mentioned earlier, than you're not\n",
      "just thinking about brand positioning. You think about experiential brand\n",
      "positioning. So what does the brand stand for?\n",
      "And it should be a multi-sensory strategy. When you think about brand positioning,\n",
      "experiential brand positioning, you not only want to think\n",
      "about. you know, what the DNA is.\n",
      "What the brand mantra is. You want to think what's the smell of the\n",
      "brand. What's the color of the brand. What's the emotion you feel when you think\n",
      "about the brand. That's a brand positioning and\n",
      "experiential brand positioning. And, it, it, it needs to be as any kind of differentiation is, it needs to be distinct from everybody\n",
      "elses. So you don't want all hotels don't smell\n",
      "the same. All soaps don't smell the same. They have different experiences.\n",
      "And then the brand promise the mantra again, it's not just three words,\n",
      "you know, cognitive words. It also needs To describe what that brand\n",
      "promise is in experiential terms. And here's where I'm going to be very\n",
      "clear of what I mean by experiential. it needs to have senses. So, it need to be what's the vision of it?\n",
      "What does it look like? What does it smell like?\n",
      "Maybe what does it taste like? What does it sound like?\n",
      "Is there music associated with it? What does it feel like?\n",
      "What are the senses? And then, when I say feel here, what I\n",
      "mean is emotions. What, what, how do you feel about it? Is it a happy brand?\n",
      "Is it a sad brand? Is it a. you know, a tragic brand? What, what, what are the emotions you feel\n",
      "with this brand? What do you think about it? That's what we've been talking about.\n",
      "How does it make you behave or act? And relate, its refers to the social\n",

      "consider or do you put this brand in and all this, this\n",
      "experiential aspect of the brand should be in all channels, all\n",
      "channels should have an experiential component to it.\n",
      "So just to go over those again. The, the sensuous is across the five senses, you want to have a consistent\n",
      "experience. The feel part are the emotions. You should appeal to the customer's inner\n",
      "feelings and build strong emotions to it. The cognitive is the intellect. The thought process.\n",
      "The intrigue. The surprise. Whatever is, but thoughts.\n",
      "The behave is the way, how people act around it.\n",
      "It can be inspirational. It can cause you to act in a certain way. And social is the part of the social system, the culture, that surrounds\n",
      "the brand. And you want to have these experiential\n",
      "functions delivered through the four P's. We're back to the four P's.\n",
      "The product, the place, the promotion. Only now, and the price, even. And now we're going to define each one of\n",
      "these four P's in experiential ways. So let me just give you examples. all of you know about, I'm sure you've\n",
      "seen this self designed, customized Nike. It's not just a product attribute anymore. It's a, a shoe that you could, can\n",

      "stores, you're seeing online become very\n",
      "experiential. These beautiful flagship stores. If any of you seen Ralph Lauren's mansion\n",
      "in New York City or in Paris or Milan. these are stores where in, in Ralph\n",

      "[MUSIC] Hi, I'm Pete Fader, I'm the Pei-Yuan Chia\n",
      "Professor of Marketing at the Wharton School and co-director of\n",
      "the Wharton Customer Analytics Initiative. I'm really excited to be starting my module of our introduction to marketing\n",
      "course. But the fact that I run a research center\n",
      "called, The Customer Analytics Initiative suggests\n",
      "that I'm a data guy, and that's true. I love looking at data about customers,\n",
      "try to figure out which customer is doing what and for\n",
      "how long and for how much money, and what kind of\n",
      "tactics can companies use to create and extract more\n",
      "value from the customer. So for me, it's all about the customer behavior, the, the patterns that we see\n",
      "over time and the kinds of strategies that companies\n",
      "can build around those patterns or to do better for\n",
      "themselves. So I want to start by going back to one of the frameworks that Barbara Kahn used\n",
      "in her modules. You might recall this slide over here,\n",
      "where she laid out the basic kinds of strategies that\n",
      "companies can follow. And a couple of these strategies are\n",
      "really clear. Everyone understands what performance\n",
      "superiority means. It's, it's just having the very best\n",
      "product out there. So whether you're an Apple, a BMW or a luxury product like a Louis Vitton or a\n",
      "Gucci. You want to have the best. Operational excellence is also pretty\n",
      "clear. you want the lowest price, you want the\n",
      "most efficient operation or the most efficient\n",
      "experience for your customer. So whether you’re talking about a Walmart\n",
      "or an IKEA or a Zara, you are really interested in keeping the cost low, keeping the process very\n",
      "efficient. That gives us operational excellence. But it's the third leg of this diagram that we're going to spend a lot of time\n",
      "on. This idea of customer intimacy.\n",
      "The basic idea makes sense. Let's focus on the customer. But exactly what does that mean?\n",
      "Who is the customer? Are we going to focus on all customers the\n",
      "same way? Just how intimate do we want to get. And how do we actually make more money on\n",
      "something that actually adds costs than some of\n",
      "these other strategies. So that's going to be the main focus of our efforts, is taking this idea of\n",
      "customer intimacy. Or, as I like to call it, customer centricity and really\n",
      "understanding what it is. Clarifying what it isn't, motivating why\n",
      "it's important, and trying to get firms to make a well informed decision about\n",
      "whether they want to pursue that kind of strategy. And, whether when or how to actually go\n",
      "after it. So that's going to be the focus of our\n",
      "work. [NOISE] I'm here on South street. One of the popular shopping areas in\n",
      "Philadelphia. And all around me would be stores that\n",
      "represent the different kinds of, of strategies that\n",
      "Barbara spoke about. Just over my right shoulder, you'll see\n",
      "one of my favorite pizza places. That's performance superiority. Right down the block, there's a number of\n",
      "fast food restaurants. That would be operational excellence. But what about customer intimacy? What kinds of stores would really be\n",
      "customer intimate, or customer-centric, as I like to say.\n",
      "And what makes them different? So let's really understand how these\n",
      "different strategies compare with each other, and then take the deeper\n",
      "plunge. Into customer centricity. So give me a few minutes to review the\n",
      "traditional steps of running a business. Running a business in a performance superior or operationally excellent kind\n",
      "of way and that's going to give us the basic\n",
      "foundation so we can really understand how customer centricity is\n",
      "different. Some of the challenges associated with it. And some of the opportunities that customer centricity can provide, that you\n",
      "might not be able to achieve, with a performance superiority or an operational\n",
      "excellence strategy. So let's take a step back and review these\n",
      "traditional steps of running a business. For most commercial enterprises the\n",
      "overall objective, beyond everything else, beyond all the tactics that a company is,\n",
      "is using and the strategy that it's hoping to follow,\n",
      "it's all about making money. And again, Barbara reviewed this and you\n",
      "don't need to be told this. it's all about maximizing the value of the\n",
      "whole corporation. It's looking at the money that we make\n",
      "today, the money that we'll make tomorrow, the money that we'll\n",
      "make ten years from now. And when we recognize that time value of that money, that today's dollars are more\n",
      "important to us than tomorrow's dollars. When we take the discounted flow of the\n",
      "company's profits, that in theory, gives us the overall value\n",
      "of the corporation. So, our job as a manager to maximize the\n",
      "value of the corporation which means, maximizing the net present value of\n",
      "profits that the company is going to get. So we agree on that.\n",
      "That part is pretty easy, conceptually. But the question is, how do companies achieve it? And that takes us back to those core\n",
      "strategies that Barbara laid out. And when you think about the most\n",
      "traditional one among them, again performance,\n",
      "superiority, operational excellence. It's all about coming up with a\n",
      "blockbuster product or service. Coming up with a brilliant idea that puts\n",
      "us steps ahead of all of our competition, and then figuring out ways to\n",
      "bring that idea, that product or service to\n",
      "market. So it's conceptualizing it, it's developing it, it's manufacturing,\n",
      "distributing, marketing that idea. That's what business is traditionally all\n",
      "about. And so the key, for most firms for making\n",
      "money, isn't only coming up with that idea but then figuring out ways\n",
      "to produce lots and lots of it. And one of the things that we've\n",
      "discovered over the years, is that producing lots and lots of quantities of this product or\n",
      "service that we want to deliver, not only helps us make greater revenue. But the fact that we're producing and\n",
      "distributing so, so much of it also brings our cost down. So the, the core focus of most traditional\n",
      "businesses is high volume, low cost. And again, coming up with a great idea\n",
      "that enables us to do that. So, so many companies have built their\n",
      "business. Around that. And even today a common question that we always ask ourselves, particularly\n",
      "when we have a new business is will it scale? Can we produce or deliver this product or\n",
      "service at scale so we can do so much of it that it's going to let us bring\n",
      "in the revenue and bring our costs down. So that's, that's, that's the basic way\n",
      "that most companies operate. And over the years, many different metrics have arisen that help companies understand\n",
      "how well they're doing it. Obviously they can look at the volumes\n",
      "that they're delivering. Obviously they can look at changes in\n",
      "their costs. Are costs coming down as we develop and deliver more and more of this product or\n",
      "service? So some metrics that show us how well we're, we're doing our business are fairly\n",
      "clear. Some of them are less clear. For instance, a very powerful metric is\n",
      "market share. So many companies today obsess over market share,\n",
      "because not only does it give them an indication of how well\n",
      "they're doing relative to their competitors in a given industry, but it\n",
      "also has these interesting properties of being a leading indicator of how well\n",
      "you will be doing. There's a lot of research that goes back\n",
      "to the 1960's, the 1970's that shows that market share is not only a good backwards indicator of how well\n",
      "you've done, but a leading indicator of how well you\n",
      "will likely be doing in the future. So, so many other metrics, like market\n",
      "share and others, are central to this product superiority,\n",
      "or operationally excellent strategy. Beyond running your business and measuring\n",
      "to see how well you're doing it, a company isn't only interested\n",
      "in fine-tuning those metrics. They're interested.\n",
      "And in fact, they're mandated to have growth. It's not enough just to do what you're doing a little bit more efficiently and\n",
      "effectively. Your shareholders demand growth.\n",
      "They want more. They want more than you can possibly have\n",
      "delivered before. And so where does growth come from? In a world characterized by a performance\n",
      "superiority or operational excellence. What are the sources of, of major growth\n",
      "that, that a company can enjoy? And we really see two different sources,\n",
      "that at first sound fairly distinct from each\n",
      "other, but when we think about it a little bit more carefully\n",
      "they're actually just different flavors of the\n",
      "same kind of growth. So let's think about them a little bit. One source of growth is taking the\n",
      "products and services that we've been delivering already and\n",
      "bringing them to new customers. Either going to new customer segments or to new geographies. So it's taking this great product or\n",
      "service and bringing it to new customers. That's clearly a new source of growth. The other source of growth that I'm sure all of you could think about, would be\n",
      "innovation. So in addition to producing and\n",
      "distributing a certain set of products or service, what more can\n",
      "we do? So let's go back to the folks who\n",
      "developed these great products and services in the\n",
      "beginning, and say give us some new products and services.\n",
      "Let's go back to the R & D people and say. Okay you have a certain degree of\n",
      "expertise that has enabled you to bring us the current\n",
      "product. What more can you do to bring us either\n",
      "variance of that product, or entirely new ones that\n",
      "haven't existed before? So that's an obvious source of growth\n",
      "would be new products, or extensions to existing\n",
      "products. So at first, this idea of taking our current product and bringing\n",
      "it to new customers, or coming up with new and different products\n",
      "seem fairly different from each other. And indeed the tactics associated with\n",
      "them, the expertise within the corporation does indeed have to be a\n",
      "bit different. When we step back and think strategically,\n",
      "both of them actually have a lot in common. Both of them share this basic idea.\n",
      "We have a certain degree of product expertise.\n",
      "How can we extend it? How can we take that product expertise,\n",
      "and either extend it to new customers or extend it to new\n",
      "products? So regardless of the specific way that you\n",
      "go after growth, the main source of growth is extending our\n",
      "overall product or service delivery. And that's what most companies have to be\n",
      "really good at. We're, we're good at doing a certain kind of thing. We're going to try to do it as, as\n",
      "efficiently or effectively as possible. Now how can we take that product expertise\n",
      "and extend it in new directions? And how do companies go about doing that? How do they go about running the existing\n",
      "business as well as figuring out how to extend the\n",
      "existing product. Well if you look at the organizational\n",
      "chart of almost any company on the planet. The company tends to be organized around the different kinds of products and\n",
      "services that it delivers. So you'll have a product manager or a\n",
      "brand manager, but it's all about having separate silos around the different\n",
      "products or services and then organizing all the activities\n",
      "that way. And so, so, very often each of these\n",
      "different silos will be responsible not only to run its own operation as efficiently as possible, but think about\n",
      "it's own way of extending that kind of product\n",
      "expertise. And so, if we sum up the way that most\n",
      "companies operate, it's all about this idea of\n",
      "product or service expertise. That's the competitive advantage that so\n",
      "many managers, so many academics, so many industry experts have focused on\n",
      "for so many years. We are the best at conceptualizing,\n",
      "developing, delivering a certain kind of product or\n",
      "service. And we're going to stay ahead of our\n",
      "competitors by becoming more efficient. By going to new markets, and always\n",
      "developing new products and services that are going to keep us a\n",
      "step ahead. Product expertise. So what I've just described to you is\n",
      "pretty standard stuff. For most of you, if you look at your\n",
      "experience as a consumer or through your work experience, you'll\n",
      "realize that that's the way that most businesses\n",
      "operate. And instead of just calling it business,\n",
      "we can now put a label on that. And that label I like to use is product\n",
      "centricity. See, in the old days we didn't need a\n",
      "special label for it because for most companies this was business, and business\n",
      "was this set of steps that I just described to you. But today, we're seeing different kinds of\n",
      "business models emerging. And so we want to now distinguish the set of practices that I just\n",
      "described. In fact I like to use a metaphor about a\n",
      "fish swimming around in water. So while the fish is in the water. It doesn't realize that it's in water\n",
      "until it jumps into a new environment. It jumps out of the water for a, for a\n",
      "moment. And realizes, uh-oh, I'm in a different\n",
      "environment now. And I kind of like the old environment\n",
      "better. I'm going to stay in the water.\n",
      "And this is exactly the kind of issue that many\n",
      "companies are facing today. They're swimming around in their own water\n",
      "of product centricity. It works.\n",
      "It keeps the business going. It gives them some opportunities for\n",
      "growth. And for many companies that's totally\n",
      "fine. But for other companies, whether it's out\n",
      "of desperation or out of opportunity, they're looking for\n",
      "different kinds of environments. They're looking for different kinds of\n",
      "strategies. We're seeing more and more companies,\n",
      "jumping out of the water, and saying is it better out\n",
      "here? How can I operate out here? Should I operate out here? And that's why we're now going to put a\n",
      "specific label on the old way of doing things,\n",
      "product centricity. So again, most of you understand that,\n",
      "this is business as usual. many of the concepts that Barbara was talking about implicitly refer to a\n",
      "product-centric approach. And just to sum up the product-centric\n",
      "world before we kind of start moving away from it, I have this one other\n",
      "slide for you here. That shows you many of the classic characteristics of a product\n",
      "centric business. And if you look up and down the slide, you\n",
      "won't find a lot that's tremendously insightful, and\n",
      "that's the point I want to make. Is that the traditional product centric\n",
      "approach to business, again, focusing on\n",
      "performance superiority or operational excellence. is, by now, second nature to most\n",
      "managers. So if you look at as the slide shows, the kinds of customers that we're going\n",
      "after, the kinds of metrics that we're using, the\n",
      "overall focus in the organization and the business, it's\n",
      "pretty standard stuff. I just want to call your attention to this one point to, towards the bottom of the\n",
      "slide. The idea of the mental process. And I love this idea of divergent\n",
      "thinking. And it goes back to an idea I mentioned a\n",
      "few minutes ago. We have this product expertise, what can\n",
      "we do with it? How can we spread it out to other kinds of\n",
      "customers, and other kinds of businesses? Again, implicity, that's the way that most\n",
      "businesses operate. And we hire people who can think\n",
      "divergently, who can take our particular core business, and think about ways of\n",
      "spreading it out, to new markets, and new products and services. So I want to make that explicit, because\n",
      "as we go on, we're going to talk about some very\n",
      "different mental processes, as well as different metrics, and all of the\n",
      "points that you see on this slide are going to become\n",
      "quite different. [MUSIC]\n",

      "## 009 Cracks In The Product Centric Approach\n",
      "[MUSIC] Okay, so we've reviewed the\n",
      "product-centric approach to business. We understand that for most companies,\n",
      "again those focusing on performance priority, or operational\n",
      "excellence, it's all about coming in with that blockbuster idea, reducing a\n",
      "lot of it, keeping the cost down, and using\n",
      "appropriate metrics for it. And we call that product centricity. Now, we're going to start talking about\n",
      "some alternative approaches, but I don't want to suggest\n",
      "that product centricity is doomed to fail. I don't want to suggest that all companies\n",
      "must move away from product-centricity. I don't want to suggest that that's a\n",
      "recipe for disaster. But I do want to suggest that there are\n",
      "some aspects of product-centricity that make it not quite\n",
      "as great as it used to be. So as you can on this slide over here, I like to say that there are some cracks in\n",
      "product-centricity. There are just a, a, a number of trends\n",
      "going on today, things that didn't really exist say\n",
      "15 or 20 years ago. That make the product-centric approach\n",
      "just a little bit less, guaranteed successful than it\n",
      "was back then. In fact, I'd like you to just take a, a\n",
      "minute or two think about what are some of the changes, today, compared\n",
      "to 15 or 20 years ago, that make product centricity just a little bit different? That take some of the shine off it, that take some of that automatic kaching, away\n",
      "from being product-centric. What would be some of the emerging trends? Most of which are trends that are here to stay, that might make a company think\n",
      "twice about whether they want to focus on\n",
      "product-centricity, or start looking towards a different kind\n",
      "of strategy. Take a moment and think about that, and then we'll run down a list of\n",
      "some of the leading factors that, that take some of\n",
      "the edge off of product-centricity. So I bet first and foremost on everyones\n",
      "list, is the idea of commoditization. See back in the old days, it was so hard\n",
      "to come up with and, and manufacture a new\n",
      "product, or deliver a service. That you would stay steps ahead of all of\n",
      "your competitors for a long period of time\n",
      "before they could come, come up with an\n",
      "equivalent idea. But today, because of technology, things\n",
      "commoditize much more quickly. Product life cycles are getting much, much\n",
      "shorter. Companies know that as soon as they launch\n",
      "something new, they have to have the next new thing\n",
      "already in process. So this idea of commoditization, takes away some of the goodness of\n",
      "product-centricity. Here's a way of thinking about it. In the product-centric world, every\n",
      "company is counting on some kind of natural monopoly. We're doing something that's going to keep\n",
      "us ahead of all of our competitors for a long period\n",
      "of time. And that's what's going to let us focus on\n",
      "the dev, developing the best of delivering the\n",
      "most efficient. But as those life cycles shorten, as\n",
      "things commoditize, it takes away some of that natural\n",
      "monopoly power. But that's just one reason. It's a big one, but by no means the only. Another important reason would be changes\n",
      "on the customer side. Our customers are so much smarter, more\n",
      "informed than ever before. It used to be that our customers were much\n",
      "more passive. They would take whatever products or\n",
      "services that we would give them, and they would say, oh, that's\n",
      "great, terrific, thanks very much, I'll figure out how to use it. But today's customers are much different\n",
      "from yesterday's customers. They're much more informed. They're much more demanding.\n",
      "And they're much savvier. And again, a big reason for this is, the\n",
      "internet. Information technology. Customers are so much more aware of\n",
      "options that are available to them, or options that might not yet be\n",
      "available to them. But that they, they clamor for than they\n",
      "ever were before. Again, the customers aren't passive, like\n",
      "they use to be. So smarter customers put much more demands\n",
      "on, on companies. And make it harder for them to extract as\n",
      "much value out of the products and services\n",
      "that they deliver. And a third way that technology makes life\n",
      "a little bit more difficult for product-centric companies, is, is the idea\n",
      "that products are, are now available everywhere\n",
      "instantaneously. If you think about what FedEx, or DHL, or UPS,\n",
      "does they take away some of that natural monopoly power\n",
      "that a company had. In the old days, companies would rely on\n",
      "the fact that no one else had a product like\n",
      "them. But even if other companies did have a product like them, customers wouldn't be\n",
      "aware of it. And even if customers were aware of it,\n",
      "customers wouldn't have access to it. But today, because distribution technology brings everything, everywhere overnight if\n",
      "you want it, it's much harder to protect yourself from other products and services that are, that are available in, in in other\n",
      "regions. So there's all kinds of ways that\n",
      "technology takes some of the, the edge off\n",
      "product-centricity. But by no means is it limited to\n",
      "technology. Part of it is a mindset.\n",
      "People are thinking globally much more than ever before. So, so customers are, are much more\n",
      "actively looking for products and services from other regions\n",
      "than they ever were before. And then there's the issue of\n",
      "deregulation. Again, regulation was a way that gave\n",
      "companies monopoly power. That they were the only game in town and\n",
      "customers had no choice. But as one industry after another\n",
      "deregulates, companies need to be much more\n",
      "competitive. And it's much harder to stay a step ahead. And in some cases, it's not deregulation,\n",
      "but it's re-regulation. It's regulations that are making markets\n",
      "much more competitive. So, again, that's another reason why\n",
      "product-centricity just isn't what it used to be. A sixth reason comes back to the customer\n",
      "again. Not only is the customer smarter, but as I mentioned before, customers are far more\n",
      "demanding than they ever were before. So in the old days, it was good enough\n",
      "just for, to, to let the customer take a bunch of products and services and figure out what they're going to do with\n",
      "it. Figure out how those different products\n",
      "and services are going to help them solve the problems that\n",
      "they have. But today's customer is much more demanding, and is insisting that companies\n",
      "not only deliver them one product or service\n",
      "at a time, but, but bundled together products and services. Sometimes, including products and services\n",
      "that the company might not make any money on. It is now much more imperative than it\n",
      "ever was before for companies to be seen as a\n",
      "trusted advisor. To be providing full fledged solutions to\n",
      "the customer and not just piece meal products and services that the\n",
      "customer will figure out how to combine together. One of the great stories along these lines\n",
      "is that of IBM. IBM, which of course stands for\n",
      "International Business Machines, used to be one of the ultimate\n",
      "product-centric firms. They were just the best at coming up with,\n",
      "and developing certain kinds of products, business machines,\n",
      "computers and so on, better than anybody else. But they had a revelation in the mid\n",
      "1990s, that they could actually make more money being\n",
      "a trusted advisor. Instead of saying here, customer, buy our\n",
      "machine, telling a customer what set of machines and services to be buying. That there are actually higher margins, especially as computers and other\n",
      "information technology equipment commoditizes, they\n",
      "can actually do better being a solution advisor. And slowly but surely, as many of you know, IBM spun off many of its business\n",
      "machines. They no longer manufacture personal\n",
      "computers. their, their presence in most other\n",
      "hardware areas has diminished. But where they're making their money\n",
      "today, is from being a customer centric solution\n",
      "provider. Is going to the customer and saying, here\n",
      "are the set of products and services you\n",
      "should be buying. And that kind of expertise doesn't\n",
      "commoditize nearly as much as any one product might. And so that idea of moving away from just\n",
      "selling products, to being a full scale solution provider is\n",
      "a major change in the last 15 to 20 years. And there's one more point that I want to\n",
      "talk about with you. And it's not necessarily the most\n",
      "important crack in product-centricity, but it's one that I like to think about a\n",
      "lot. And that's the data. See, today's technology enables us to\n",
      "collect and manage, and utilize data about customers, in a way that we just\n",
      "could have never imagined before. So if you think about old companies. Think about Henry Ford, who was one of the, the real originators of\n",
      "product-centric thinking. He had no idea how many customers he had. He didn't know whether he was selling one\n",
      "car to each of ten million different people, or whether he\n",
      "was selling ten million cars to one person. He didn't know.\n",
      "And frankly he didn't care that much. Because he was so product-centric in his\n",
      "thinking, that it was just a matter of turning that crank, of pushing products out the\n",
      "door. Of keeping the volumes up and keeping the\n",
      "costs down. But today given these other cracks and\n",
      "product-centricity, it's much more important for companies to be using the\n",
      "data about their customers. To be understanding who's buying what. And for how long, and what other products\n",
      "that they're buying. So the information systems give us the\n",
      "possibility of developing business models that were unimaginable before. But could actually be more successful than\n",
      "the product-centric approach. And I want to give you a couple of\n",
      "examples of that. [MUSIC]\n",

      "## 010 Three Cheers For Direct Marketing\n",
      "[MUSIC] So while the Harris and Tesco stories are\n",
      "terrific, I will provide pointers to some books that summarize each\n",
      "of those stories quite well. I want to emphasize that they're not the\n",
      "only ones who have built a business around a deep understanding of their\n",
      "customers, and by no means are they the first. In fact, the first companies that actually\n",
      "built a business in this manner, around their customers, has\n",
      "happened many, many years ago. And it emerges from the sector of direct\n",
      "marketing. When I say direct marketing most people don't have a real positive association\n",
      "with it. They think about low end products. They think about infomercials and other,\n",
      "you know, not great marketing activities. it, it's, it's not the kind of industry\n",
      "that you aspire to be associated with or learn\n",
      "from. But when you strip away what most\n",
      "customers see from direct marketers, and look at the\n",
      "actual business practices below the surface, you realize that it's actually quite\n",
      "impressive. If you, if you look at, at what direct\n",
      "marketing is really all about, it is really building\n",
      "the business around the customer. But not just, the customer in some generic\n",
      "sense, but around each and every customer. It's about understanding the relationship\n",
      "with each different customer. Who has bought what from us.\n",
      "For how much. What kinds of products have they inquired about.\n",
      "What kinds of products have they returned. What interactions have they had with\n",
      "customer service. That's what direct marketing is all about. It's having a much richer relationship\n",
      "between the company. And the customer. What's interesting about it is, that\n",
      "direct marketing is not a new concept. it's been around since 1967, when Lester\n",
      "Wonderman looked at these emerging set of data\n",
      "driven business practices.\n",
      "And said, you know what? There's actually a lot we can do, we can\n",
      "actually formalize some of these business practices, and come up with\n",
      "some best practices associated with them. But even if you don't spend a lot of time\n",

      "lifetime value. Something that you've heard about before,\n",
      "that we're going to spend more time talking about, that's, that, that\n",

      "[MUSIC] Now that we understand what product\n",
      "centricity is all about and we've discussed some of the cracks in\n",
      "product centricity. And even some of the opportunities from\n",
      "companies to escape from and maybe do better than a product-centric approach,\n",
      "I want to start moving away towards customer\n",
      "centricity. But before I give you a definition and\n",
      "talk it through, I'd like you to think about what customer\n",
      "centricity means, based on your experience as well as what I've discussed so far. So in order to do that, I want to work\n",
      "with a series of examples here. In fact, on this slide, you'll see the\n",
      "names of four very famous retailers. Three of them operate on a global level,\n",
      "so Walmart, Apple, Starbucks. I'm sure most of you are familiar with\n",
      "them. And Nordstroms. A high end very, a high touch department\n",
      "store chain here in the US. If you're not familiar with them not a big\n",
      "deal. I think you'll appreciate the story\n",
      "anyway. What I'd like you to do is take a moment,\n",
      "and from your experience with, your perceptions of these firms, decide which\n",
      "of them would be highly customer centric. So I want you to think about what customer centricity means in light of our\n",
      "discussion so far. And decide which of these, could be one, could be all, could be none, up to you, would be above the bar in terms of\n",
      "customer centricity. So think about what customer centricity\n",
      "means, and which of these firms qualify in that\n",
      "regard. Think about that for a second. And then I want to talk through all four\n",
      "of them. In my book, none of these firms are truly\n",
      "customer centric. Now, I want to be careful about this. I have great admiration for all these firms.\n",
      "I'm a big customer of all of them. I really like what they do. But all of them for different reasons. Fail to be truly customer centric, nearly\n",
      "as much as perhaps some of you thought when in deciding which of them, which of these firms are or aren't customer\n",
      "centric. So I'm just going to take a few moments to\n",
      "talk through each one of them, and then, finally we'll bring\n",
      "up our definitions of customer centricity. First there's Walmart. Now again, Walmart is a terrific firm, but\n",
      "Walmart knows, surprisingly little about any one\n",
      "of it's customers. Unlike Harris, unlike Tesco, unlike so\n",
      "many other retailers out there, Walmart does not have a loyalty\n",
      "program. Walmart has made very little effort to\n",
      "date to try to figure out exactly what each\n",
      "customer's doing. And how they can influence each customer's\n",
      "behavior. So while Walmart might not make a lot of\n",
      "efforts to understand what any one customer's going to buy, they make\n",
      "great efforts to understand the customers as a\n",
      "whole. They understand regional differences. They understand when certain kinds of\n",
      "events occur. For instance, when a hurricane is about to\n",
      "hit the south eastern US, they need to fill the stores with water\n",
      "and batteries and so on. So they understand the customer in a generic way but they make very little\n",
      "effort to understand the customers in a very\n",
      "specific granular way as a direct marketer would\n",
      "suggest. And you know what, that doesn’t bother me because Walmart isn’t intending to be a\n",
      "direct marketer. If you think about the Walmart business\n",
      "model, it’s about selling in great volumes, it’s about\n",
      "bringing the costs way down. So, in many ways, Walmart is a prototypical, and a wonderfully\n",
      "successful, product-centric firm. Let's come up with products that we can\n",
      "sell a whole lot of, that's going to let us bring\n",
      "our costs down. And let's figure out ways to extend our\n",
      "product goodness, and, and all the aspects that I mentioned for\n",
      "product-centricity apply to Walmart. So in many ways, I, I excuse them. I allow them to focus on product\n",
      "centricity because they're so good at it. There are a very few firms in the world that can operate in an operationally\n",
      "excellent manner as well as Walmart can. It's a similar but different story for\n",
      "Apple. because Apple again, is the classic\n",
      "performance superiority firm. They don't spend a whole lot of time doing market research, to figure out exactly\n",
      "what the customer wants. They don't spend a whole lot of time\n",
      "focusing on segmentation and real granular analysis to try to predict what any one\n",
      "customer is going to do over time. What Apple focuses on, is leveraging its product expertise. Is taking the kinds of products that\n",
      "they've already developed, and figuring out what are the next ones that\n",
      "they should develop. So again, a classic example of product\n",
      "centricity, and they do it better than most company, most other companies on the\n",
      "planet, and they can get away with it. Now, Walmart and Apple, for the most part are focusing on doing product-centric\n",
      "things. Operational excellent for Walmart,\n",
      "performance superiority for Apple. They are doing some smart things at the margin to understand their customers\n",
      "better. For instance, Walmart is spending a little\n",
      "bit more time developing technology that's not\n",
      "only going to help them learn about their customers, but\n",
      "be even more operationally efficient than\n",
      "they were before. So, for instance, here in the U.S. They\n",
      "have a new program they call Scan & Go, a mobile app\n",
      "that lets people scan products as they move around the\n",
      "store so as they check out, the whole scanning process\n",
      "happens much faster. It's a brilliant idea that lets them be\n",
      "more operationally excellent, but also lets lets them start tagging individual customers and tracking them\n",
      "over time. So they're starting to take on some more customer centric initiatives without\n",
      "sacrificing the operational excellence. And Apple is also starting to do a number of\n",
      "things. Again, small initiatives not driving the\n",
      "business that are letting them understand their customers a\n",
      "little bit better. Whether it's tracking peoples music\n",
      "preferences through iTunes. Or some of the activities that they do in\n",
      "the Apple retail stores. Slowly but surely, they're starting to\n",
      "develop a better understanding of their customers at a more\n",
      "granular level. And who knows? One day, if and when competition catches up and Apple can no longer be the product\n",
      "leader that they are, they could probably turn around and start to be\n",
      "a great customer-centric firm as well. But today, it's not quite as mission\n",
      "critical as it is for other firms. The third company on our list, Starbucks,\n",
      "is a very interesting contradiction. At a local level, Starbucks or any coffee\n",
      "retailer, is very, very customer centric. The Barista, the person on the the other side of the\n",
      "counter, the person who makes your coffee, knows a lot about you\n",
      "if you're a regular customer. Not only does he or she understand your\n",
      "coffee preferences and what other items you might buy in that store but just through the casual conversations you\n",
      "have with them, they might know what movies you\n",
      "like, what kind of clothing you’d like to buy, something about your job, your family and they often make recommendations\n",
      "to you. That are going to make your life better even if Starbucks itself isn't making a penny off of those\n",
      "recommendations. That is customer centricity. Okay, being a trusted advisor to the\n",
      "really good customers, finding ways to lock that customer in and\n",
      "so on. So, the paradox is, while Starbucks is\n",
      "very customer centric at a local level, they are not that customer\n",
      "centric at a national level. You take your Starbucks loyality card, and\n",
      "you bring it a Starbucks in another city or another country and show it to\n",
      "them and say, I'd like the usual please, they have no\n",
      "idea who you are. So not only can they not meet your\n",
      "immediate needs, but it's hard for them to be a trusted advisor and to make other\n",
      "recommendations to you when they have no idea about anything\n",
      "about your history. So to me, that's a really key point. It's not enough for a company to be\n",
      "customer centric some of the time when they know who you\n",
      "are. But a truly customer centric company will\n",
      "identify you and will be able to value you and make recommendations no\n",
      "matter what kinds of interactions you have with\n",
      "them. Whether you go from store to store,\n",
      "whether you go online or offline. That's what customer centricity is all\n",
      "about. Now Starbucks to their credit recognizes\n",
      "this. And they're coming up with all kinds of\n",
      "interesting technologies that are going to let them collect and\n",
      "integrate your data across stores and across other touch points you\n",
      "have with them. They recognize that the opportunities and\n",
      "the necessity for customer centricity is at\n",
      "least as important as it is to come up with the\n",
      "next great coffee flavor. So again, it's that balance between\n",
      "focusing on the product and focus, focusing on the customer that so many\n",
      "companies are now struggling with. And finally, there's Nordstrom's. And while that might be the least familiar\n",
      "company on the list, especially to those of you outside the US, it might be the\n",
      "most interesting example to help us understand what\n",
      "customer centricity really is and isn't. But whether you've shopped at a Nordstrom\n",
      "store or not, you might be familiar with the story that makes Nordstrom so\n",
      "supposedly customer-centric or not. And here's the way it goes. Nordstrom's a high end department store.\n",
      "They sell clothing, shoes, and so on. One thing they don't sell is tires. Yet, one day someone walked in to a\n",
      "Nordstrom store. Supposedly in Fairbanks Alaska, and wanted\n",
      "to return a set of tires that obviously they could not\n",
      "have bought at Nordstrom's. Perhaps there was a tire store at that\n",
      "location before Nordstrom's opened shop. And Nordstrom's being so incredibly\n",
      "customer centric, gave them the money back for tires that they didn't buy\n",
      "at Nordstrom's. Now is that customer-centricity or what?\n",
      "I like to say, or what. If you think about it for a minute, is that really customer-centric or is it\n",
      "actually kind of stupid? Does it make sense to give someone money\n",
      "back for a product that they couldn't possibly have\n",
      "bought from you? For me, I say, most of the time it's\n",
      "probably a bad idea to do that. And the question is, under what\n",
      "circumstances would it be a good idea to do that? Think about that for a second. When would it make sense to give someone\n",
      "money back for a product that they couldn't have\n",
      "possibly bought from you? When would it make sense? And here's the answer. If that customer is incredibly valuable to\n",
      "you, and I'm talking about future value, I'm talking about the fact that we expect\n",
      "this customer to be buying so much from us in the future that if we\n",
      "don't give them money back for the tires that they thought they\n",
      "bought from us, if we don't give them the money back today, we're going to lose\n",
      "that value. If that's the case. We'll happily give you the money back for\n",
      "the tires that you didn't buy. Maybe we'll double the money back.\n",
      "Who knows. So it all depends on the value of the\n",
      "customer. The future value.\n",
      "The lifetime value of the customer. If that's sufficiently high. Then we'll roll out the red carpet for\n",
      "you. And if it's not. And for most customers it wouldn't be. Then we would politely decline. We might still be nice to you, of course,\n",
      "but we're not going to give you money back if we don't\n",
      "see the value in it. And that's the problem with Nordstrom's.\n",
      "Nordstrom's offers such wonderful service. They treat everybody so incredibly well.\n",
      "Regardless of the value of that customer. And that's the problem with Nordstrom's,\n",
      "is that because they fail to focus on figuring out the\n",
      "future value of each and every customer, they're just\n",
      "going to treat everybody really well. And there's a lot to be said for that,\n",
      "it's a wonderful company. I like knowing that when I go in there I'm\n",
      "going to be treated really well. But I think that they're missing some\n",
      "opportunities by picking and choosing a little bit more. In the old days it was impossible to do that, but today Nordstrom's, like every\n",
      "other retailer, has the capability to collect the data and\n",
      "use technology to do a little bit more\n",
      "targeting and a little bit more selection to figure out\n",
      "who is worth the extra special treatment. And who, doesn't necessarily deserve it. So to me the Nordstrom's example is a\n",
      "great example of, of where a product and\n",
      "customer centricity collide. And what I want to do now is, is to start focusing more on what customer\n",
      "centricity really means. And that's what we're going to do next. [MUSIC]\n",

      "strategy associated with Performance superiority or\n",
      "operational excellence. and we looked at the different\n",

      "quite as great as it used to be, and started touching on businesses that\n",

      "but we haven't defined it yet. We've given a number of examples of\n",

      "customer centric, IBM, Harrods, Tesco, as well as a number of\n",
      "companies that are terrific companies, companies like Walmart, Apple, Starbucks,\n",
      "Nordstrom, but don't qualify as necessarily being over the\n",
      "hurdle, but are making great strides towards\n",
      "customer centricity. So what about your business, or what about these businesses around me here on South\n",
      "street? How do we determine whether a business\n",
      "really is or isn't customer centric? In other words, what is the definition of\n",
      "customer centricity? So what I like to ask my students to do is\n",
      "to write that down. So how do you define customer centricity, based on what we've discussed so far, based on the examples that we've looked\n",
      "at? So in fact, I'd like you to take a minute\n",
      "and just jot down whether it's a full sentence, or even just a few words that you would associate with\n",
      "customer centricity. Take a minute and do that, and then I'll,\n",
      "then I'll give you my perspective, my definition on\n",
      "what customer centricity is. Okay, so you gave me your definition of\n",
      "customer centricity. I'm going to show you mine. But before I put the words on the screen, because a lot of it's just going to be\n",
      "words on a screen. I, I want you to look at these words, and\n",
      "think about them a little bit differently. I want you to think about how this\n",
      "definition of customer centricity, and what it implies, just how radically\n",
      "different it is from conventional product-centric\n",
      "business practices. In fact, I want you to look at these words\n",
      "and tell me, if you were to start doing exactly these kinds of\n",
      "tactics, if your company was to start having these\n",
      "kinds of perspectives, why you'd be fired? In other words, there are fireable\n",
      "offenses in this definition over here, and what are\n",
      "they? Okay, if you look at it, there's a lot of\n",
      "things that might make sense. It all fits together, sounds nice. Hopefully, it's well-aligned with your own\n",
      "definition of customer centricity, but I really do want to emphasize just how\n",
      "different it is. So for instance, what are, what are the\n",
      "fireable offenses here? One of them would be this idea of select set of\n",
      "customers. In the product-centric world, you can't\n",
      "have a select set of customers. In the product centric world, we're so\n",
      "dependent on generating as much volume as possible,\n",
      "on the selling as much stuff as we can, that\n",
      "we can't really afford to be selective. It's going to be hard to keep our costs\n",
      "down if we're selective. So the whole idea of having and\n",
      "emphasizing a select set of customers, very much runs\n",
      "against the grain of, of many businesses. Another would be the bottom line on this\n",
      "definition. The idea of really focusing on maximizing\n",
      "the long-term financial value of certain kinds\n",
      "of customers. In most situations it's hard for a company\n",
      "to do that. Given the pressures of Wall Street, and just the conventional ways we look at\n",
      "business. We're so short-term oriented, we got to the hit the quarterly\n",
      "numbers. Whereas in the customer-centric world, and\n",
      "going back to many of the examples that I mentioned before, we want\n",
      "to invest in the right customers. We're willing to, to recommend products\n",
      "and services that we're not going to make any money off\n",
      "of. For instance, going back to the IBM\n",
      "example, there was a case where a company was willing to\n",
      "recommend other products and services. So IBM was actually losing opportunities. But locking in customers for the long run,\n",
      "being seen as a trusted adviser in some cases can be\n",
      "worth it, that the long run profits that we can get from\n",
      "customers can be greater than just trying to get them to buy\n",
      "another thing right now. So again that's a radically different way\n",
      "of doing business. Another part, higher up in this\n",
      "definition, is the idea of aligning our research and development\n",
      "activities around our customers. The way it usually works is, we go to the\n",
      "R and D people and we say, hey R and D guys, gals, come up with\n",
      "the next block buster for us. You've been so good at, at coming up with\n",
      "these terrific products and services. What's the next big thing that you have\n",
      "for us? But here we're talking about something\n",
      "different. Here we're saying, hey R and D guys and gals, here are really valuable\n",
      "customers over here. Let's come up with something for them,\n",
      "something that's going to make them even more locked in, something that's going to\n",
      "create greater long-run value for them, and something that's going to help us\n",
      "recruit even more customers like them. R and D folks, come up with something for\n",
      "them. It's a tot, totally different way of doing\n",
      "business. Now, if you think about that last point,\n",
      "it's not quite as radical as it might sound because, after all, what\n",
      "made our valuable customers so valuable? The fact is, they like the products and services that\n",
      "we develop, and so if we leave it up to the R and D people, whatever they come up with next our, our customers will probably love\n",
      "it anyway. But it's the mindset, it's the idea of\n",
      "going to R and D and putting these valuable\n",
      "customers front and center. It's, it's the way, just changes the conversation, and perhaps the design,\n",
      "within the organization. That's what starts making it\n",
      "customer-centric. So that's my definition of customer\n",
      "centricity. But again, those are just words on a page,\n",
      "what we really want to think about is what this\n",
      "means? See, there's a lot of companies that might\n",
      "adopt that definition or something else like it,\n",
      "and then put a big banner on the lunchroom wall for all the employees saying we are now\n",
      "customer centric. Well, it's not that easy. There's a lot of challenges in actually bringing this definition and this mindset\n",
      "to life. And so I want to think now about some of those challenges as well as some\n",
      "of those opportunities. So we can see in the rest of the slide over here about what customer\n",
      "centricity really implies. And I want to give you a few examples\n",
      "about that. So again, thinking about the fact that customer centricity requires us to be\n",
      "forward-looking. We're looking at not which customers have\n",
      "been valuable, but which customers will be\n",
      "valuable using the data, the models, the technology that\n",
      "we have available to us. So what does that mean? So here's a very specific example. So many companies have some kind of\n",
      "salesperson of the month incentive and they tend to be\n",
      "backwards looking. We're going to reward salespeople based on\n",
      "how much stuff they sold last month or quarter or\n",
      "year. I want it to be forward looking. Think about it this way If you have that\n",
      "kind of backwards-looking program, you're encouraging, you're incenting your\n",
      "salespeople to try to close sales that were going to happen\n",
      "anyway. Like, you know, hey, I've got to get this\n",
      "one done before the month ends so I can get my\n",
      "bonus. That's not necessarily helping the company\n",
      "in the long run. In order to have real long-run benefits,\n",
      "you have to be future-looking. So here's the way a salesperson of the\n",
      "month incentive should work. I want a company to calculate the lifetime\n",
      "value of each and every customer. And let's do that at the beginning of the\n",
      "month, or the quarter, or whatever. And then do it at the end of the month or\n",
      "the quarter. And let's ask ourselves, not, not just how\n",
      "much stuff we sold to the customer, but how much did we\n",
      "elevate their lifetime value? So instead of us going to customers who\n",
      "are going to buy things anyway, and just watch them buy things they were going to buy, let's try to build relationships with\n",
      "customers. Maybe they weren't inclined to buy, and you know what? Maybe they didn't, by the end of the\n",
      "month. Well, we're closer to making this sale. We've impro, we've improved the\n",
      "relationship. We've lengthened and maybe deepened the\n",
      "relationship. That we think in the long run we've, we will create much more value that wouldn't\n",
      "have been there. That's how I want to reward the sales\n",
      "people. Okay? On future value that they're sowing the\n",
      "seeds to create. Now, that's risky. That requires some faith.\n",
      "It requires some data. It requires some models. But if you can do it, and I'm aware of a\n",
      "number of firms that have in a variety of different businesses, then you're actually much\n",
      "better off. Think about it from the salesperson's\n",
      "perspective. Instead of just rewarding them based on\n",
      "what they've done. You want to encourage them to build\n",
      "relationships. You don't want to just close sales.\n",
      "You want to build long lasting relationships. You want them to invest in the customers,\n",
      "even if they're not getting anything out of it\n",

      "[MUSIC] So now that we've laid out the definition\n",
      "of customer centricity, we've spoken a little bit about some of\n",
      "the challenges that it requires companies to meet changing its centric\n",
      "structures and so on. What I like to do is just to step back and review all the aspects of living in a\n",
      "customer-centric world. What does that mean? Now we'll spend a little bit more time talking about some of the other aspects of\n",
      "it. So, so first, if you live in a customer-centric world, well let me ask\n",
      "you this question. What's the overarching objective for the\n",
      "commercial enterprise? You remember I, I asked that and we discussed it before for the\n",
      "product-centric enterprise. But what is it for the customer-centric\n",
      "enterprise? So usually when I ask this question people will give me a lot of customer\n",
      "oriented answers. Building loyalty, creating satisfaction,\n",
      "getting people to buy things. Yeah, that's all nice.\n",
      "That's all terrific. We want to do all that and we hope the\n",
      "customer-centricity will help us do those things but that's not the\n",
      "single overarching objective. The overarching objective is the same as it was before, to maximize shareholder\n",
      "value. To maximize the profits of the company in the short run and the long run, recognizing the time value\n",
      "of money. And even though that point seems kind of\n",
      "silly, it's the same thing, that's why I want to\n",
      "emphasize it. That in the end, the overall objective of\n",
      "any commercial [LAUGH] enterprise is to make as much money as\n",
      "possible. The problem is this. There's too many people who think that the\n",
      "money-making thing is uniquely associated with product\n",
      "centricity, but it's not. There's lots of different paths that we\n",
      "can follow, and while customer-centricity is\n",
      "quite different in many ways from product centricity, it's a path\n",
      "that actually might help you get there faster\n",
      "and better. So, If I want to emphasize that point,\n",
      "that we're trying to achieve the same over-arching goal but in\n",
      "a very different way. So let's talk about how we achieve it. Again, going back to product centricity,\n",
      "for most firms, the performance superior ones and the operationally excellent ones,\n",
      "it was all about blockbuster idea. Let's produce a lot of it, let's produce it efficiently, and let's think about the\n",
      "next thing to produce. And again, that formula has worked for so\n",
      "many companies, still works today. So what is it in the customer-centric\n",
      "world? What is it that we celebrate in the\n",
      "customer-centric world going back to the, the Harrah's and the Tesco\n",
      "and the IBM? Well, this, this point might be more\n",
      "subtle, but it's very, very important. What we celebrate in the customer-centric\n",
      "world is customer heterogeneity. The idea that not all customers are\n",
      "created equal. The idea that some customers are just\n",
      "inherently much more valuable, much more profitable\n",
      "than other customers. See, in, in the old days, companies didn't\n",
      "know the profitability of customers. They didn't understand how customers were\n",
      "different from each other. And again, they didn't care, because they\n",
      "were so intent on just pushing products out\n",
      "there. Once they started realizing that customers are different from each other,\n",
      "at first it was a nuisance. Oh my gosh! Different customers, we're going to have\n",
      "to talk to them in different ways. And develop different products for them.\n",
      "It was a nuisance. It added to our costs.\n",
      "It was a hassle. And the more we learned about our\n",
      "customers, the more we realized they are really, really\n",
      "different from each other. And it's, and it's always true, we can't\n",
      "avoid that. So unless we're going to paint ourselves\n",
      "into a corner, and only work with one kind of customer, we need to acknowledge and celebrate that\n",
      "heterogeneity. We need to find a way to say that these\n",
      "differences across the customers not only exist, but\n",
      "they're a good thing. Let's find the kinds of customers who can\n",
      "be very valuable to us. Let's make them valuable, and let's find\n",
      "others like them. And, [UNKNOWN] at the same time, let's find ways of\n",
      "dealing with the other prob, customers in a\n",
      "reasonably profitable manner. So, we celebrate heterogeneity. One point I want to emphasize along the\n",
      "way, I, I, say this over and, over and, over again, but it is\n",
      "important to make this explicit. Is that when we're focusing on\n",
      "heterogeneity and we're focusing on the, on the, the profitability of our customers, we're talking about future\n",
      "profitability. Notice that I'm always pointing over here\n",
      "to the future. It's great to look at past profitability. In many cases, that will be a guide\n",
      "towards future profitability but it's not a perfect one\n",
      "to one match. So we need to use our data, we need to use\n",
      "models and technology in order to project the\n",
      "future value of our customers. So the celebration of heterogeneity is not\n",
      "only what the customers have been worth. And which customers have been the most\n",
      "valuable? But is which ones we think will we be most\n",
      "valuable. Going back to my example about the MBA\n",
      "students and the airlines. Most of the value is what we're going to\n",
      "create and extract in the future. And that's the really pivotal role of this\n",
      "idea of customer lifetime value. Now here's a tough question for you. Okay, we're going to want to measure CLV,\n",
      "we're going to want to manage around it, how do we do that? So, when we look at a company as it starts\n",
      "changing from being product centric to customer\n",
      "centric, what kinds of tactics change? So one point that I want to emphasize\n",
      "right now, [SOUND] what were going to go into much greater\n",
      "depth in module three are those three tactics that lie at the\n",
      "heart of customer centricity. That are the, the tactics that make it\n",
      "possible for companies to potentially make more money being\n",
      "customer centric than product centric. And you see those words right here, it's all about customer acquisition, customer\n",
      "retention, customer development. And a lot, lot of you might be looking those words and saying well that's\n",
      "not new. Companies have been acquiring customers\n",
      "forever. Companies have been thinking about the retention and development, making\n",
      "customers more valuable. These ideas are not new, and you now what? They're not!\n",
      "That's true! But in many cases, these ideas are, are,\n",
      "kind of treated at a fairly low level within the\n",
      "marketing organization. Because the marketing organization is\n",
      "often there just to support the product-centric\n",
      "blockbuster mentality. So it's all about, how can we get as much\n",
      "stuff out there as quickly as possible? It's all about coming up with the message. Very often, branding might be associate\n",
      "with product centricity. Not always but in many cases, it is. And so, instead, as we start to think\n",
      "about how customer's different from each other,\n",
      "we're going to want to ask questions about which kinds of\n",
      "customers should we be acquiring. How much should we be willing to spend to\n",
      "acquire them. On the retention side, should we try to\n",
      "keep everybody, should we roll out the red\n",
      "carpet for everyone? Or should we be a little bit more\n",
      "selective. And when it comes to customer development,\n",
      "are there some customers who we can make into better\n",
      "customers than others. And how do those tactics tie in with the\n",
      "acquisition and the retention? So I'm going to spend much more time talking\n",
      "about it later on, but my point here is that these three tactics\n",
      "need to be elevated. The people who are going to be working on them need to be higher in the\n",
      "organization. The people who are running the marketing\n",
      "function have to be at least as painfully aware as acquisition, retention, and development,\n",
      "as they are around some of the branding ideas that, that Barbara\n",
      "spoke about. And so we're going to get back into that. But I just wanted to plant that seed right\n",
      "now. One point that I've mentioned from time to\n",
      "time, but I want to make a little bit more explicit here would be\n",
      "challenges for the organization itself. Again instead of having an organization, that's organised purely around the\n",
      "different kinds of products and services, we want to have a customer-centric\n",
      "organizational structure. Ideally, the whole org chart would be\n",
      "built around the different kinds of customers we have. And then below them, the different ways\n",
      "that we're going to create and extract the profits\n",
      "from them. I'm going to give you a nice example of a company that's seriously exploring\n",
      "different organizational approaches towards customer\n",
      "centricity. It's a company that today focuses quite a bit on developing and distributing\n",
      "blockbuster products. But more and more they're realizing that\n",
      "they actually need to be, or could be a direct marketer.\n",
      "The company is Proctor & Gamble. What does Proctor & Gamble know about you\n",
      "or me? Actually not much. Today, Proctor and Gamble's customer would\n",
      "be the retailer. The Walmarts, or other grocery chains who\n",
      "they sell their products to. But Proctor and Gamble recognizes that\n",
      "with this shift towards customer centricity, with the\n",
      "shift towards direct marketing, that eventually their customer will be me\n",
      "and you. And they want to start to understand who\n",
      "the really valuable customers are. How we can sort them out from other\n",
      "customers. And what are things that we can do to\n",
      "create more value for those customers? So here's an example of a really nice\n",
      "initiative, one of many that Proctor & Gamble is\n",
      "trying out. It's called My Black Is Beautiful and it's\n",
      "aimed at African American woman. And P&G is determined that this is a\n",

      "goods advertising. First, look at the bottom of the slide. You see a number of different P&G brands\n",
      "being advertised together. It's pretty unusual for a company like P&G, or again other\n",
      "packaged goods manufacturers, to use that kind of umbrella branding, and going\n",
      "back to some of Barber's content. and if you look, look higher up on the\n",
      "slide, you'll notice that they're also talking about recipes and music and all kinds of things that P&G isn't involved\n",
      "with. But this should be an example of Procter\n",
      "and Gamble trying to position itself as a\n",
      "trusted adviser. That they're offering all kinds of\n",
      "products and services to this valuable customer segment that\n",
      "they don't necessarily make any money on, but they want them to see P&G as someone who\n",
      "has their best interest in mind. And if you look at the bottom of the slide, you'll notice something\n",
      "fairly unusual. You see here this the mention of, of a\n",

      "Procter and Gamble. But, Queen refers to Queen Latifah, the\n",
      "popular actress, and so they developed a whole line of cosmetics specifically for African\n",
      "American women. This goes back to our definition of\n",
      "customer centricity. Going to the R&D people and saying, you\n",
      "know what, instead of coming up with a blockbuster product that\n",
      "everybody's going to buy, here's a valuable customer\n",

      "Procter & Gamble will be successful. I don't even know if this is the right\n",

      "product and customer-centricity. You might remember a chart that I showed\n",

      "as we go through our planning practices. But, but, one kind of customer matters\n",
      "more than others. Going back to the Proctor and Gamble\n",
      "example that I mentioned before, there there's a\n",
      "tremendous amount of clarity on it. Proctor and Gamble knows, that today, their customer is the\n",
      "retailer. I wouldn't be surprised, if 20 years from\n",
      "now, Proctor and Gamble said, the customer is the consumer, but\n",
      "they're moving in an orderly way. So it's important to first sit down and figure out, who the, the customer could\n",
      "be. Who are all the different constituents,\n",
      "who could qualify as being the customer? And then having a healthy discussion, to\n",
      "try to come up with the consensus about, which one we're going to focus on, and\n",
      "which other ones, might still be on our horizon. We also want to think about, what are the barriers associated with customer\n",
      "centricity. A few of them, I've mentioned already, it\n",
      "might be the data. Perhaps we can't get the data, if you'll\n",
      "be able to individual customer doing things, over\n",
      "time, there might be regulatory issues. There might be reasons why, we can't treat\n",
      "customers differently, for instance in the pharmaceutical space. There might be cultural reasons, it's just\n",
      "impossible for this company, to move from a product centric, to a\n",
      "customer centric view. If the company's been focused on, developing and distributing block busters\n",
      "for all of its existence, it's hard all of a\n",
      "sudden, to pivot around the customers. So there's a number of barriers that, that\n",
      "can be in place. The ones that I just mentioned are fairly\n",
      "general, they're fairly broad, but every company is going to have its own\n",
      "challenges. And before saying, we're going to become\n",
      "customer centric, it's very important to come up with that list, and\n",
      "think real carefully about, existing barriers and new ones, that can\n",
      "be arising, to, to do a real careful inventory, of, of, of\n",
      "barriers towards customer centricity. And of course at the same time, you\n",
      "want to think about the resources that you could\n",
      "bring in, to address or maybe preempt, some of those\n",
      "barriers. Very often, the resources are going to be\n",
      "financial. You're going to have to invest money, to\n",
      "build the information technology systems and to hire employees, and to\n",
      "start developing a data infrastructure. Sometimes, they're going to be cultural,\n",
      "we're going to have to hire the right kind of people, who can think around, conversion thinking\n",
      "around the customer, instead of diversion thinking\n",
      "around the product. So, there's a, a number of, of, of\n",
      "different ways that we can start thinking in advance, about overcoming the barriers,\n",
      "before the, the barriers actually start impeding\n",
      "our progress. Another important consideration is,\n",
      "competition. It's interesting, that in some cases,\n",
      "seeing your competitors taking moves toward customer centricity,is a very\n",
      "strong incentive for you to do so. So, for instance, we see a number of industries where customer centricity\n",
      "has really made great strides, such as, financial\n",
      "services, such as, hotels and hospitality, where's it's\n",
      "competitive pressures. Hey, they're moving towards customer\n",
      "centricity, we should be doing it, too. But in many cases, the best motivations to\n",
      "move towards customer centricity, it's the entire opposite of\n",
      "that, hey no one's doing it, let's be the first. That would be the example of Hammers and\n",
      "Tesco. Sometimes, being the only one doing the\n",
      "customer centric thing, is the way to make it most\n",
      "successful. So again, you want to think about the\n",
      "ecosystem for your industry, and is it better for\n",
      "everybody to be customer-centric, is it better for\n",
      "it to be only you, and that might drive your\n",
      "decision. In the end, the big question is, do you\n",
      "want to be customer centric or not? Does it make sense for your company? And if not now, when should you be\n",
      "customer centric? And think about, again, a company like\n",
      "Proctor and Gamble, Walmart and so on. Making plans now, for changes that they\n",
      "can make in a few years. And as you decide, whether to be customer\n",
      "centric, the timing about it, you want to start laying some of the, the\n",
      "baby steps towards it. So, it might be developing technology initiatives like, the Scan and\n",
      "Go Program, that I mentioned for Walmart. It might be an organizational initiative\n",
      "like, My Black Is Beautiful for Proctor and\n",
      "Gamble. It might be other kinds of experiments\n",
      "that, that a company is going to run. Let's just set aside, a part of the\n",
      "organization or group of customers. Let's treat them differently and see if we\n",
      "can. And see if it's more profitable than,\n",
      "than, than handling them, in the usual product\n",
      "centric manner. Those are the kinds of decisions, I want to see companies making. And I think, its very important for all\n",
      "companies, to at least be thinking about it, so they can make an informed decision, about what customer centricity might mean\n",
      "for them. [MUSIC]\n",

      "## Data Driven Business Models\n",
      "[MUSIC] So I want to talk about a couple of\n",
      "examples about companies that have used information technology and specifically the data about their\n",
      "customers. To come up with business models that are\n",
      "quite distinct, from product centricity. And so two examples I want to share with\n",
      "your very briefly, would be Harrahs, the casino chain here in the US, and Tesco, grocery retail chain in the United\n",
      "Kingdom. In many, in many ways the stories are\n",
      "quite similar. Despite the fact that they're very\n",
      "different companies operating different businesses\n",
      "and different geographies. In both cases, these were companies that were getting beaten up in their\n",
      "businesses. They weren't nearly as large as some of\n",
      "their competitors, they didn't have the resources to compete head-to-head, in a traditional,\n",
      "product-centric manner. And so they turn to the data. They turn to a deep understanding about\n",
      "their customers to draw insight and to let them change their business models\n",
      "in a way that actually let them rise to the top of\n",
      "their industries. So let's talk first about Harrahs casino\n",
      "chain here in the US. They're having a hard time competing\n",
      "against other chains that just had deeper pockets,\n",
      "greater resources. It was hard for them to develop the\n",
      "products and services to compete on a head to head\n",
      "basis. So Harrah's instead turned to its data,\n",
      "and in particular, developed an amazing loyalty program. Now many companies develop loyalty\n",
      "programs, but few of them were able to draw the actionable insights that Harrah's was to\n",
      "truly understand at a granular level what each customer's\n",
      "doing. Not only which games they're playing, but\n",
      "what meals they're eating, what room preferences they have,\n",
      "what entertainment options they seek. And to understand, when that customer is\n",
      "likely to change his behavior, when he's likely to walk away from the\n",
      "table, and what kinds of things that Harrah's itself could do to\n",
      "change their behavior for the better. What kinds of messages and offers to\n",
      "provide, at the right time, and through the right channel, in order to create and\n",
      "extract more value from that customer. So Harrah's was just brilliant in drawing\n",
      "those insights and understanding, for instance,\n",
      "what someone's threshold was. If this customer goes down about say,\n",
      "$150, it's time to intervene. It's time to offer them a meal or some\n",
      "kind of other activity which is going to make\n",
      "them feel great. But equally importantly, is going to reset\n",
      "their mental account. And so when they sit back down again,\n",
      "their threshold is back towards zero. So Harrah's was very smart about\n",
      "understanding that kind of messaging. And it's a very similar story for Tesco. Again, a, a competing very, very tough with other\n",
      "big grocery chains in the UK. Sansbury, Morrisons, and so on. They turned to the data, they developed\n",
      "the loyalty programme. They really understood their customers in\n",
      "some very clever ways, they would understand\n",
      "which households were buying a lot of their\n",
      "meals and, and other products from TESCO. And which ones weren't and specifically\n",
      "which kinds of products were the light\n",
      "households not buying from TESCO. So, Tesco knew which kinds of coupons to\n",
      "send to which kinds of households, at which time, in order to\n",
      "get them to buy more. And this helped them not only grow the\n",
      "business with those customers, but also helped them to\n",
      "compete more effectively. So when Wal-mart bought a small chain and\n",
      "entered the UK. Tesco knew which customers were most\n",
      "vulnerable to switch to Walmart, and which products they'd likely\n",
      "buy from Walmart. So Tesco knew, again, which coupons to\n",
      "send to which households, at which time, in order to really hold on to those\n",
      "customers and bolster their business. So by understanding its customers. TESCO is able to do a great job defending\n",
      "itself against Wal-mart and, and staying at top of the grocery\n",
      "business in the UK. So those are only two examples of\n",
      "companies that have turned to the data in addition\n",
      "to developing fine products and services but really leaning heavily on the data and a rich deep understanding of their\n",
      "customers. In order to pivot their business model, in\n",
      "a way that they could never achieve, through\n",
